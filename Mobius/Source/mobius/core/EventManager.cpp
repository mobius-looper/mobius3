 * 
 * A class encapsulating event scheduling tools for a track.
 * This contains an EventList which contains Events.  EventList is
 * a relatively pure list manager, up here we know more about the
 * semantics of the events and their relationships.
 *
 * An event may be a "primary" event (aka top-level or parent), or it
 * may be a "child" event owned by a primary event.  
 *
 * The primary event list is linked with the "next" field, the child event
 * list for a given parent is linked with the "sibling" field.  An event
 * may be on both the primary event list and a child list, but a child
 * event is not necessarily on the primary event list.
 *
 * The most common child event is JumpPlayEvent which if possible is
 * scheduled before its parent event to compensate for audio latency.  
 * A JumpPlayEvent may be on the same frame as the parent event if we were
 * not able to schedule the parent far enough in advance, but it will never
 * be later than the parent event.
 *
 * The sibling list is maintained in creation order, it is undone
 * in the reverse order.  Sibling lists are used for "stacking" functions
 * that defer the functions untl after something happens.
 *
 * The primary event list is also maintained in creation order for undo, 
 * though in practice it will usually also be in time order except for
 * ScriptEvents (waits).
 *
 * Child events are found on:
 *
 *   StutterEvent
 *     JumpPlayEvent at the end of the stuttered cycle.
 *
 *   InsertEvent
 *   MultiplyEvent
 *       Adds either MultiplyEndEvent or InsertEndEvent
 *       A RecordStopEvent to stops recording before the end event
 *
 *   MultiplyEndEvent
 *   InsertEventEvent
 *       RecordStopEvent at the end of the recorded section of the
 *       multiply or insert.
 *
 *   Multiply/Insert end triggers.
 *       Any function performed during a multiply/insert that is not
 *       handled as a special mode ending function.  Will be given
 *       to the the Multiply/InsertEndEvent as a child.
 *
 *   SwitchEvent
 *       Anything that can be stacked as a control event or that makes
 *       sense after the switch.
 *       A single JumpPlayEvent shared by all stacked events.
 * 
 *   RecordStopEvent
 *       Can be a stacking event if the record ending is synchronized.
 *       I see at least have SwitchEvent in LoopSwitch.cpp, but we should
 *       be doing this consistently for others!!
 *
 *   ReverseEvent
 *       Has a ReversePlayEvent, a special case of JumpPlayEvent.
 *
 *   MuteEvent
 *       Has a JumpPlayEvent.
 * 
 *   MidiStartEvent
 *       Has a JumpPlayEvent if this is MuteMidiStart function.
 * 
 * Generic play jumps are the most common, found on:
 *
 *   MuteEvent
 *   MoveEvent
 *   RateEvent
 *   ReplaceEvent
 *   SlipEvent
 *   SpeedEvent
 * 
 * Potentially used by, but disabled:
 *
 *   RealignEvent
 *     MuteEvent scheduled if function is MuteRealign.
 *
 *   MidiStartEvent
 *     MuteEvent scheduled if function is MuteMidiStart.
 *
 * INSERTION RULES
 *
 * With one exception, the current rule is that primary events will be
 * sorted in both creation and time order.  The exception is ScriptWait
 * events which may be scheduled for any time.
 *
 * Another rule is that a primary event cannot be inserted into the list
 * at a time *before* any other primary event on the list.  This means
 * that it is possible to calculate the effective mode and latency when
 * an event (and it's play jump) is scheduled, and this cannot be changed
 * by later event insertions.
 *
 * This rule will no longer hold if we allow functions to have different
 * quantization levels, for example InsertQuant=Loop and RateQuant=Subcycle.
 * We would schedule a PlayJump to mute before the InsertEvent, but if
 * a RateEvent was then scheduled at an earlier time, it would change the
 * effective latency to be used in scheduling the PlayJump.  To handle
 * the general case, we would need to be able to reschedule all mode
 * and latency sensitive events after any insertion into the event list.
 *
 * EVENT FREEING
 *
 * Any event that still has a parent in the event list must not be freed.
 * They will be marked processed and freed when the parent event is freed.
 * 
 * When a parent event is freed, we also free processed children.  We do
 * not expect to find unprocessed children, if we do they leak for safety.
 * 
 * In a few rare cases (what are they!) an event may be on the child list
 * of two parents, but it only points to the primary parent.  Care must
 * be taken when freeing the secondary parent not to free the shared child.

 * Schedule a generic "play jump" prior to a parent event.

 * Note that the Loop is passed in because we may be using this
 * to schedule things in the next loop before a switch completes.
 * 
 * The only thing we need to care about here is the location
 * of the event, what the jump actually does will be determined
 * when the event is eventually evaluated based on the context
 * in effect at that time.
 *
 * NOTE: Some of the older functions may still set the
 * nextLayer and nextFrame fields because they're not yet set up
 * to deal with deferred evaluation.
 * 
 * There may be more than one jump on the same frame in cases
 * where several functions are stacked on the same frame.  The
 * jumps and their parents need to be maintained in insertion order.
 * The events must also be undone in reverse order.
 *
 * SUBTLETY: If this is the child of a Record alternate ending,
 * and we're synchronizing so the RecordStopEvent is deferred waiting
 * for a sync pulse, the loop length will not have been set yet.  In this
 * case, the jump has to happen at frame zero with full latency loss.
 * It *must not* be calculated relative to the current mFrame because that
 * is still advancing and we don't know when it will stop.
 *
 * FUTURE:
 * 
 * I really dislike explicit play jump scheduling.  It would be easier
 * for Functions if we could automatically create a jump pseudo event whenever
 * we notice that we're within the latency period of a primary function event.
 * 
 * BRAKEAGE!
 *
 * I don't think the latency calculaions are correct for jumps associated
 * with speed changes. IO latency needs to be adjusted for what the
 * speed will become, not what it is now?  This makes speed jumps variable
 * and may cause them to be after jumps for other events scheduled
 * on the same frame.
 *
 * !! think about this.  Once we schedule a speed switch event
 * and determine where the jump should go, any further events stacked
 * on that frame need have their jumps on the speed event's jump frame.
 * There has to be awareness of the previous events jump frame
 * Ugh, this is just more goddamn trouble than it's worth...

 *
 * Also passing in a pending SyncEvent that will happen during this 
 * interrupt.  If this will occur before any other scheduled event return it.
 *
 * NOTE: The Extra Frame Range
 *
 * When determing the events that are within the range of this buffer
 * you would ordinarilly do:
 *
 *    lastFrame = startFrame + availFrames - 1
 *
 * For example for a starting frame of zero and a buffer of 128 the 
 * frames in the buffer are numbered 0 through 127.  Frame 128 won't 
 * technically be reached until the next interrupt.  For reasons I don't
 * remember we have for a long time not done this subtraction and considered
 * events that fall just outside the current buffer to be processed
 * in the current interrupt.  Comments indiciate this was "so we can
 * detect loop events".  

 * Although arguably incorrect, it actually doesn't matter since we
 * always process events BEFORE consuming the frame we are currently on.
 * So whether we process the event at the end of the current buffer
 * or at the beginning of the next buffer makes no difference.  At it
 * shouldn't.  There might be some subtle legacy logic that requires
 * the loop event to be processed early because the frame is about
 * to wrap but I can't see why that would be.  We should experiment
 * with that someday.  The side effect of this is that range checking
 * on events in EventManager have to allow them to fall one frame
 * outside the buffer without logging an error.

/**
 * Relatively general utility to calculate quantization boundaries.
 *
 * TODO: Here is where we need to add some form of "gravity" to bring
 * quantized back to the previous boundary rather than the next one
 * if we're within a few milliseonds of the previous one.
 *
 * If "after" is false, we'll return the current frame if it is already
 * on a quantization boundary, otherwise we advance to the next one.
 * 
 * Subcycle quant is harder because the Subcycles divisor can result
 * in a roundoff error where subCycleFrames * subcycles != cycleFrames
 * Example:
 *
 *     cycleFrames = 10000
 *     subcycles = 7
 *     subCycleFrames = 1428.57, rounds to 1428
 *     cycleFrames * subcycles = 1428 * 7 = 9996
 * 
 * So when quantizing after the last subcycle, we won't get to the 
 * true end of the cycle.  Rather than the usual arithmetic, we just
 * special case when subCycle == subcycles.  This will mean that the
 * last subcycle will be slightly longer than the others but I don't
 * think this should be audible.  
 *
 * But note that for loops with many cycles, this calculation needs to be
 * performed within each cycle, rather than leaving it for the last
 * subcycle in the loop.  Leaving it to the last subcycle would result
 * in a multiplication of the roundoff error which could be quite audible,
 * and furthermore would result in noticeable shifting of the 
 * later subcycles.
 * 
 * This isn't a problem for cycle quant since a loop is always by definition
 * an even multiply of the cycle frames.
