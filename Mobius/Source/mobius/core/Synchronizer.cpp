 * 
 * A class encapsulating most of the logic related to external and
 * internal synchronization.
 * 
 * This one is a little funny in that it contains things that are called
 * from several levels of the system.  But the synchronization logic is
 * so closely related, I wanted to keep it all in one place rather than 
 * distributing it over Mobius, Track, InputStream, and Loop.  It's a bit
 * like a Mediator pattern.
 *
 * At the top, Synchronizer is called by Mobius during each audio Interrupt
 * to handle sync events that came in since the last interrupt.  MIDI events
 * are maintained in a MidiQueue, the queue maintains a MidiState that
 * is updated as events are removed from the queue.  MidiState keeps
 * track of start/stop, clock counts, and beat counts.
 * 
 * Synchronizer manages a MidiTransport object which coordinates the
 * control over a millisecond timer and a MIDI device used to generate
 * midi clocks in "out" sync mode.  As we send out MIDI clocks we also
 * route them into another MidiQueue managed by MidiTransport so that we
 * can track drift between the timer and the audio stream.  In this way, 
 * tracking internal clock drift works much the same as tracking an
 * external MIDI clock.
 * 
 * During an audio interrupt, we will be passed an AudioStream (now MobiusContainer)
 * containing information about VST/AU host sync events such as beats or 
 * bars that will happen within the next audio buffer.  The VST/AU
 * sync events, and events from the internal and external MIDI queues
 * are converted into a list of Event objects with appropriate offsets
 * into the current audio buffer.  These events will be injected
 * into the Event list of the active Loop in each Track so that each
 * track can take action on them differently.
 * 
 * Sync events for inter-track sync are a bit more complicated because
 * the master track must be advanced first before we know if it
 * crosses any interesting sync boundaries.  This is handled by 
 * giving the TrackSyncMaster track a higher priority than the others,
 * Mobius will process it first in each interrupt.
 *
 * So, the Synchronizer is the funnel into which three types of sync
 * events go to be converted into the appropriate Event objects for
 * each track.  These sync Events are then merged with the events scheduled
 * on the Loop.  
 *
 * When the loop is eventually ready to process a sync Event, it just
 * turns around and calls back to Synchronizer::syncEvent for processing.
 * Sync event processing happens during three loop modes:
 *
 *  SynchronizeMode
 *     - a recording has been requested and we're waiting for the
 *       appropriate time to start
 *
 *  RecordMode
 *     - recording has begun, we're waiting for a function to stop the
 *       recording, waiting for the quantized end to be reached, or waiting
 *       for the end of an AutoRecord
 *
 *  PlayMode (MuteMode, ConfirmMode)
 *     - the loop has finished recording, we maintain a SyncTrakcer to 
 *       compare the receipt rate of sync pulses to the advance in the
 *       audio stream, the loop is adjusted if it drifts too far
 *       out of sync with the pulses
 *    
 * Loop will also call back to synchronizer when various events with
 * possible synchronization consequences occur.  These include ending
 * the initial record, multiplying or inserting new cycles, 
 * redefining the cycle length with unrounded multiply/insert, speed shift,
 * or "transport" operations like mute, restart, and pause.
 *
 * TRACKER EVENTS
 *
 * Once a SyncTracker has been locked it will generate its own events
 * for beats and bars according to the frame advance during each interrupt.
 * These will start close to the beat/bar events being received from the
 * external source but may drift over time.  
 *
 * It is important to understand that once a SyncTracker has been locked
 * all other tracks that follow the same source will beging following
 * tracker events *not* source events.  For example, say all tracks are
 * configured to follow MIDI clocks.
 *
 * The first track to be recorded watches pulses from the MIDI device,
 * calculates a tempo and rounds off the recording so we have a nice
 * integral beat length.  The tracker is now locked.  If another MIDI
 * follower begins recording it waits for pulses from the tracker rather
 * than the MIDI device.  The effect is similar to track sync, once the
 * tracker is locked it becomes the "master" track that everyone else follows.
 * This ensures that all tracks that follow the same source will end up
 * with compatible lengths which we can't ensure if we follow jittery
 * clocks like MIDI.  This also solves a number of other problems related
 * to realign and drift.  Realign is always done to the tracker not the
 * actual source so that all tracks realign consistently.  Drift correction
 * when it happens is detectted once by the tracker and applied to all
 * followers.  
 *
 * This applies to SYNC_MIDI and SYMC_HOST.  SYNC_OUT has historically fallen
 * back to normal Track Sync with the master track, but now that we have
 * Tracker Sync we could provide an alternate to follow OutSyncTracker 
 * which has a stable beat (subcycle) length.

/*
 * This is too complicated for my taste, think more about ways to simplify this!
 *
 * The number of beats in a bar is ideally defined in the Setup, but we
 * have historically fallen back to subCycles parameter from the Preset
 * if Setup beatsPerBar isn't set.  The problem is that this makes BPB
 * track specific since each track can have a different preset.
 *
 * The exception to this rule is SYNC_HOST where we always let the 
 * host determine the time signature.  
 *
 * In practice beatsPerBar is almost never changed, but I'm not sure how
 * advanced users have been using it so we'll continue to fall back to the
 * Preset.
 *
 * BPB is used for several things:
 *
 *    - quantizing the start/end of a recording
 *    - Realign when RealignTime=Bar
 *    - calcultaing the number of cycle pulses during recording
 *    - length of an AutoRecord bar
 *
 * Since this is a fundamental part of the SyncTracker calculations, we
 * capture beatsPerBar in the SyncTracker when it is locked.  Thereafter
 * this value will be used in all calcultaions even if the Preset or
 * Setup changes.  The idea here is that you recorded something against
 * an external loop with a certain time signature, and once that recording
 * ends you no longer control the time signature of the external loop.
 * The Preset can change BPB for other purposes like polyrhythms, but for
 * the purposes of Realign the BPB in effect when the SyncTracker was locked
 * remains constant.
 *
 * So...determining the effective beats per bar is defined as:
 *
 *    If the Loop/Track follows a locked SyncTracker, get it from the tracker.
 *    Else use the Setup
 *    Else use the Preset active in the Track
 *
 * It's even a little more complicated than that because when recording
 * starts we'll save the BPB in the SyncState temporarily until the
 * recording ends.  This because BPB was used in the quantization of the
 * record start and we should be consistent about quantizing the ending.
 *
 * THINK: It would make life easier if we only used the Setup and we let
 * it change during recording.   This might have strange results but 
 * maybe no stranger than explaining to users why changing Presets has
 * an effect on sync tempo.

 * Indirectly called by Function::invoke whenever we're in Record mode
 * and a function si recieved that wants to change modes. This will be called
 * from a function handler, not an event handler.
 *
 * Called by LoopTriggerFunction::scheduleTrigger, 
 * RunScriptFunction::invoke, and TrackSelectFunction::invoke, via
 * RecordFunction::scheduleModeStop.
 * 
 * In the simple case, we schedule a RecordStopEvent delayed by
 * InputLatency and begin playing.  The function that called this is
 * then free to schedule another event, usually immediately after
 * the RecordStopEvent.  
 *
 * If we're synchronizing, the end of the recording is delayed
 * to a beat or bar boundary defined by the synchronization mode.
 * There are two ways to determine when where this boundary is:
 *
 *   - waiting until we receive a number of sync pulses
 *   - calculating the end frame based on the sync tempo
 *
 * Waiting for sync pulses is used in sync modes where the pulses
 * are immune to jitter (track sync, tracker sync, host sync).  
 * Calculating a specific end frame is used when the pulses are not
 * stable (MIDI sync).
 *
 * If we use the pulse waiting approach, the RecordStopEvent is marked
 * pending and Synchronizer will activate it when the required number
 * of pulses are received.
 *
 * If we calculate a specific end frame, the event will not be pending.
 *
 * If we're using one of the bar sync modes, or we're using AutoRecord,
 * the stop event could be scheduled quite far into the future.   While
 * we're waiting for the stop event, further presses of Record and Undo 
 * can be used to increase or decrease the length of the recording.
 *
 * NOTE: If we decide to schedule the event far enough in the future, there
 * is opportunity to schedule a JumpPlayEvent to begin playback without
 * an output latency jump.

 * MidiInput.  SyncTracker also has an average pulse width but working from
 * the tempo is more accurate.  Should compare someday...

 * NOTE: THis is not used and I never did get it working, but it

 * around for awhile.
 * 
 * Given a MIDI sync event, calculate the offset into the interrupt
 * buffer near where this event occured.
 *
 * MidiEvents are timestamped with the millisecond timer before they
 * are sent, this is captured in the "clock"  field of the MidiSyncEvent
 * when it is moved to the MidiQueue, and then copied from MidiSyncEvent
 * to the "millisecond" field of the Event.
 *
 * We saved the millisecond counter at the beginning of the last interrupt
 * in mLastInterruptMsec.  The distance between these represents the 
 * location of the MIDI event within the last buffer.  We convert that 
 * distance in milliseconds to frames and leave that as the interrupt buffer
 * offset for the event in the current interrupt.
 *
 * A consesquence of this is that MIDI events are always processed 1 interrupt
 * later than they happened.  Resulting in a latency of around 5ms with
 * a 256 frame buffer.  If we slid all the events to the front of the buffer
 * rather than trying to offset them the response time would be better
 * on average, though more jittery and lead to worse inaccuracies in 
 * the recorded frame count, which results in more frequent drift adjustments.
 *
 * UPDATE: This is flakey.  There is a common overflow of 264 (8 frames) 
 * and less common underflows ranging from -1 to -30.  The underflows seem
 * to coincide with system load, such as dragging a window around.  Both
 * are disturbing and are probably due to PortAudio not calling the interupts
 * in close to "real" time.  May need to be using the "stream" time instead?
 *
 * The 264 overflow is probably just roudning since a buffer is not an even
 * multiple of msecs.

/**
 * Called on each pulse after a synchronized loop has finished recoding.
 *
 * There are two things we do here:
 * 
 *   - Check pending Realign events
 *   - Check "external start point" events
 *
 * Originally we checked drift here too but that has to be deferred
 * until the end of the interrupt because we share SyncTrackers among
 * several tracks.
 *
 * Track sync pulses are only interesting if we're in Realign mode
 * waiting for a master track location.  Other pulses just increment
 * the SyncTracker.
 * 
 * SYNC_MIDI: The pulses will be from the SyncTracker since once the
 * first MIDI loop is recorded and the tracker is locked we no longer
 * directly follow MIDI clocks.
 *
 * SYNC_HOST: The pulses be from the SyncTracker.
 *
 * SYNC_TRACK: The pulses will be from the master track.
 *
 * SYNC_OUT: The pulses will be from the timer, not the SyncTracker.
 * ?? Really why ??
 * 
 * EXTERNAL START POINT
 * 
 * For sync sources that have a SyncTracker, the tracker will reach
 * the "external start point" whenever the pulse counter wraps back to zero.
 * This will have been recorded in the Event.isSyncStartPoint property.
 * This can trigger a Realign if RealignTime is START, the
 * SyncStartPoint function, or a script wait statement.
 * 
 * REALIGN
 *
 * If there is a RealignEvent marked pending, then the track is waiting
 * for a realign pulse.  The RealignTime parameter from the Setup
 * determines which pulse we will wait for.  
 * 
 * If we have a pending Realign, SYNC_OUT and OutRealignMode=midiStart,
 * then it is more accurate to wait for the actual loop start point
 * (frame zero) rather than watching the pulses.  In this scenario
 * we are forcing the external device back into sync with the loop, and
 * the pulse counter may have drifted slightly.  When OutRealignMode=restart
 * then we obey the pulse counts because we are forcing the loop to be in sync
 * with the external device.
 *
 * The Realign/SYNC_OUT/OutRealignMode=midiStart case will therefore be
 * handled by the loopLocalStartPoint callback rather than here.
 * Note that in this case we ignore the RealignTime parameter and always
 * wait for the loop start point.  It might be interesting to allow
 * RealignTime, but we would then need Loop callbacks for each cycle
 * and subcycle, and would need to send a MIDI SongPosition event to 
 * orient the external device relative to the loop location.

 * There are too many places where the internal clock is being
 * controlled in "loop event time" rather than "real time" that we

 * for clock control in advance, similar to the JumpPlay event
 * but that is quite complicated, and at ASIO latencies, provides
 * very little gain.  The best we can do is be more accurate in our
 * initial drift calculations.
 *
 * UPDATE: Reconsider this.  Stopping clocks isn't that critical
 * we can do that before or after latency.  Now that we usually
 * follow the SyncTracker it doesn't matter as much?
 * 
 * Restarting or continuing ideally should be done before latency.
 * I suppose we could do that from the JumpPlay event.  This wouldn't
 * happen much: MidiStart after ManualStart=true and certain mutes that
 * stop the clock.
 *
 * Changing the clock tempo should ideally be done pre-latency, but this
 * only matters if we're trying to maintain a loop-accurate pulse frame.
 * With the new SyncState, we can change the tempo any time and adjust
 * the internal framesPerPulse.
