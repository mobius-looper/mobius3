 *
 * Terminology:
 *
 * Audio Block
 *   A block of audio being prepared/consumed for the audio interrupt.
 *   These will be of fixed size, and may contain content from many
 *   different loops and layers.
 * 
 * Track Block
 *   A fragment of the Audio Block between Loop Events.  If there
 *   are no loop events within range, the Track Block will be the
 *   same size as the Audio Block.
 *
 * Layer Block
 *   A fragment of the Track Block to which content from a single
 *   layer will be placed by the output stream.  A Track Block
 *   may have several layer blocks.  Layer blocks are non-overlapping but
 *   do not have to be adjacent.

 * Transfer frames from a layer into the loop buffer.

 * Don't go through the logic unless we have a postive frame count.
 * Can get here with zero frames if we've got several events
 * stacked up on the same frame, only adjust mLastPlayLayer etc. if
 * we actually play something.
 *
 * Normally we fade if either the layer or play frame differ, but not if
 * the special "shift" flag is on which is set when shifting between layers
 * with the same content.   But shift is meaningful only if the last layer
 * is non-null, it can be set when we come out of mute quantized on a 
 * loop boundary, so we still need  to fade.
 *
 * If we are beginning the pre-play of the record layer we have to be
 * careful with a deferred fade from the end of the play layer to the
 * beginning of the record layer.  We cannot do a fade in because
 * it would cause a content break at the loop point.  But there may also
 * be content from older layers that also had a deferred fade.  If feedback
 * is reduced significantly at the start of the record layer, this
 * can cause a break in the old content.  So we have to take a hybrid
 * approach of capturing a fade tail so the old content won't have a break,
 * but we do NOT start a fade into the record layer so the deferred
 * fade from the previous layer can be preserved.
 * 
 * Pitch Shift Subtlety
 *
 * If we're entering a pitch shift, there will be a break due to plugin
 * latency that we're not yet compensating for.  Failing compensation, 
 * we at least need to capture a fade tail and fade in even if it looks
 * like we're playing seamlessly.
 *
 * When we leave pitch shift, there won't be a gap, but we're going to 
 * suddeny stop using the shifter and pick up playing from where we
 * think we are (audibly).  This will result in a jump forward from
 * what is actually being sent to the sound card since there are still
 * frames buffered in the plugin.  Here we need to capture a tail
 * to feed to the plugin so the buffered frames fade nicely.  Then we
 * need to force a fadeIn because of the jump.
 *
 * Later, the higher-level play method needs to know that just
 * because we've stopped using the plugin there may still be stuff
 * in it that needs to be drained.
 *
 * If we're changing pitch shift, but not going to or from 1.0, then
 * just play normally.

/*
 * Speed Change
 *
 * Speed shift when there are no scheduled events in range is easy, 
 * just take all of the available frames, pass them through the 
 * Resampler, and record however many you get back.
 *
 * Speed changes in the input stream are much more complicated than in 
 * the output stream because the input stream is where we process
 * scheduled events which can change the rate.
 * 
 * When there is an event in range it will "break up" the block of interrupt
 * frames.  We must determine exactly how many input frames we will
 * consume to "reach" the event, Resample that many frames, record the result,
 * then switch over to OutputStream to play a corresponding number of
 * frames, then when both streams are back in sync, process the event.
 *
 * The hard part is determining the minimum number of frames frames we need
 * to consume to reach the event.  If we overshoot, and the event
 * changes the rate, we're technically out of alignment with
 * the output stream by a few frames.  This may not be that bad if we
 * can do a gradual adjustment later?
 *
 * DECIMATION
 *
 * When we are playing at reduced speed, we will drop input frames
 * to match the rate that we're playing.  In half speed we will
 * advance the play frame only 128 in order to produce 256 interpolated
 * frames, so we must decimate 256 input frames down to 128 in order
 * to stay in sync.
 *
 * The decimation algorithm will result in keeping one frame then
 * dropping one or more following frames.  This set of one kept
 * frame and n dropped frames is called the "decimation range".  
 * The entire range logically represents one frame after decimation or
 * one "decimated frame".  The decimation range does not need to be 
 * constant.  In half speed the range will always be 2 frames, in 
 * quarter speed 4 frames, etc.  But rates that don't divide evenly
 * may result in range patterns like 2,3,2,3 or 4,5,5,4,5,5 etc.
 *
 * This is represented graphically as:
 *
 *   x-x-x-x-
 *
 * where 'x' represents a sample from the input stream that we will
 * keep and '-' is a sample we will skip.  Other examples:
 *
 * x-x--x-x--x-x--
 * x--x---x--x---
 * 
 * There are two ways to think about "reaching" a decimated frame,
 * we can reach it by having enough source frames such that the first
 * frame in the decimation range will be reached or that the
 * last frame in the decimation range is reached.  It seems most intuitive
 * to me to have it be reaching the first frame.  This will result
 * in a "remainder" that must be carried over into calculations in the
 * next stream block.
 *
 * To find the number of decimated frames in a stream block first
 * take the number of frames in the block times the sample rate.
 * For a rate of .5 and a block of 3 we get 1.5, which can be thought
 * of as one full decimation range then half of another.
 *
 *     x-x|-x-|x-x|-x-
 *
 * Since we consider reaching the first frame in a decimation range 
 * the same as reaching the decimated frame, we can round up and consder
 * there to be 2 decimated frames in the first block.  But note that the
 * rest of the decimation range "spills over" to the next block.  The first
 * frame of the next block must be considered part of the decimation range
 * of the last frame in the first block and ignored.
 *
 * The number of frames to ignore in the next block is determined
 * by computing a "remainder".  The remainder is 1.0 minus the fractional
 * part of the decimated frame calculation.  In this example 1.0 - .5 = .5.
 * In the next block the remainder is factored in as:
 *
 *   Decimated Frames = ceil((Block Frames * Speed) - Remainder)
 *
 * or:
 *
 *   3 * .5 = 1.5 - .5 = 1 ceil = 1, remainder 0
 * 
 * Consider a rate of .25 and a stream block of 5 frames.
 * 
 *     x---x|---x-|--x--|-x---|x---x
 * 
 * The number of decimated frames in the first block is 5 * .25 = 1.25 rounded
 * up to 2.  The remainder is 1.0 - .25 = .75, meaning that there is .75 
 * of the decimation range that spills over into the next block.  
 *
 * If the block sizes are irregular due to event processing, we can encounter
 * a situation like this:
 * 
 *     x---x|---|x-|--x--|-x---|x---x
 * 
 * There is a remainder of .75 going into the second block, the number of
 * decimated frames in the second block is calculated as:
 *
 *    3 * .25 = .75 - .75 = 0
 *
 * All of the frames in this block are in the decimation range of the
 * last frame in the previous block and must be ignored.  So the entire
 * block is ignored.
 *
 * For event processing, we must determine the minimum number of block
 * frames that must be consumed to reach the event frame.  At rate .25:
 *
 *             e
 *   |x--|-x---x--|-x---x---x---
 *    0    1   2
 *       
 * The first block has 3 frames, the second has 8, there is an event on
 * decimated frame 2.  In the first block we had:
 *
 *   3 * .25 = .75 ceil = 1, remainder .25
 * 
 * In the second block we have:
 *
 *   8 * .25 = 2 - .25 = 1.75 ceil = 2, remainder .25
 * 
 * We know there will be 2 decimated frames in this block so the event
 * on frame 2 is within range.  To determine the minimum number of
 * frames to consume, return to the first 1.75 value which says there
 * is .75 of the a decimation range at the end of the block.  To determine
 * how many frames are in that range divide this by the rate.
 *
 *   .75 / .25 = 3
 *
 * Then subtract one since the first frame in the range is the one we have
 * to reach.  So with 8 frames in the block, and 3 - 1 extras we can
 * consume 6 frames to reach the beginning of the decimated frame 2.
 *
 * Hmm, no.  It isn't that easy.  Consider a rate of .75, where 20
 * frames become 15.  This can be decimated in several ways:
 *
 *   xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-
 *   x-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xx
 *   xx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-x
 * 
 * We need to know exactly how the algorithm will be choosing frames to skip
 * to determine if an event frame will be in range.  In a rate of .33, 
 * 20 frames becomes 6.66
 *
 *   x--x---x--x---x--x--
 *   x---x--x---x--x---x-
 *
 * If the skip ranges are of different size, we have to know how the
 * algorithm will select the size of the range.
 *
 * Must this be pushed into the Resampler?
 * 
 * INTERPOLATION
 *
 * If the rate is 2.0 we're in double speed.  To fill a 256 frame block
 * the output stream will have to consume 512 frames and decimate them
 * to 256.  The input stream will have to make a corresponding interpolation
 * of 256 frames into 512 to match.  We'll represent that graphically as:
 *
 * x+x+x+x+
 *
 * Where 'x' is a sample from the source block and '+' is an interpolation.
 * In the simplest form of interpolation, it would be a duplication
 * of the previous frame.   Quad speed would be:
 *
 * x+++x+++x+++x+++
 *
 * And some rates may not result in evenly spaced interpolations:
 *
 * x++x+++x++x+++x++
 *
 * Again we have to be able to detect events within range of the stream block.
 * Consider a block size of 4 with an event scheduled on frame 6:
 * 
 *        e
 * xxxx|xxxx|xxxx|xxxx
 *
 * The input samples will be interpolated into this for recording:
 *
 *       e     
 * x+x++x+x++|x+x++x+x++|x+x++x+x++|x+x++x+x++
 *
 * Start by multiplying the block size by the rate to get the effective number
 * of frames in the block.  4 * 2.5 = 10 so we know the event on frame 6 is
 * in range.  So the question again is, what is the minimum number of
 * frames to consume from the stream block to reach the expanded frame 6.
 * Take the number of frames we're trying to reach divided by the rate:
 *
 *    6 / 2.5 = 2.4 ceil = 3
 *
 * Since we have to perform this computation anyway, we don't need to 
 * make the (block size * rate) calculation to determine if the event
 * is within the block.  If this is true:
 *
 *     ceil(((event frame - record frame) / rate)) < block size
 *
 * Then the event is in range.
 *
 * ALTERNATE APPROACH
 *
 * Upon receiving the input buffer, immediately perform a rate transposition
 * of the entire buffer.  Then knowing the full size of the adjusted buffer
 * look for events as usual.  If there are events in range, break up the
 * block as usual.
 *
 * Only if an event changes the rate do we have more work to do.  Stream
 * keeps the rate at which the last block was transposed.  When it changes
 * we correlate the frame where the rate change happened to the original
 * stream block, then do a new rate transposition from there and continue.
 * This can also result in rounding errors but may be easier overall to code?
 * The tradeoff is that there is the potential to do too much work if we
 * have several rate changes in the buffer.  But this would be very unusual and
 * we probably should be collapsing them if they occur?
 *
 * Interpolation, rate 2.5
 *
 *   xxxxxxxx
 *   x+x++x+x++x+x++x+x++
 *            e
 *
 * Where 'e' is a rate change on frame 9.  To correlate to the corresponding
 * source frame divide by the rate, 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 ceil = 4.  
 *
 * Interpolation, rate 2.0
 *
 *   xxxxxxxx
 *   x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+
 *            e
 * 
 * 9 / 2 = 4.5 ceil 5
 * 8 / 4 = 4 ceil 4
 * 
 * When an event is on frame 9, there is some ambiguity over where the
 * new rate should be applied.  Is the "full interpolation range" of source
 * frame 4 to be kept, or can we truncate the interpolation range and start
 * the new rate.  The later is easier and seems fine.
 *
 * It sure seems like we're going to have rates that produce rouding
 * errors such that when we're done splitting the input buffer we will
 * either not have filled enough of the output buffer, or have gone too far.
 * In the case where we haven't filled enough, we'll need to go back and
 * play at least one more frame.  If we've gone too far, we can either backup
 * the play frame and pretend it didn't happen or keep the remainder for
 * the next interrupt?
 * 
 * Decimation, rate 0.5, event on 2
 *
 *   xxxxxxxx
 *   x-x-x-x-
 *       e
 *
 *   2 / .5 = 4
 *   3 / .5 = 6
 *
 * This looks right.
 *
 * 
 * Decimation, rate 0.33
 *
 *   xxxxxxxx
 *   x--x---x--x---x--x---x--x---
 *             e
 *
 * Event on 3: 3 / .33 = 9.09 ceil = 10
 * Event on 2: 2 / .33 = 6.06 ceil = 7
 * 
 * This just feels easier and less error prone to me.
