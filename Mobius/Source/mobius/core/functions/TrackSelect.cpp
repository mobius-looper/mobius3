/**
 * This one is complicated because of TrackLeaveAction and mode sensitivity.
 * Another case where it would be nice if we could make the MobiusMode
 * have this logic.
 *
 * The behavior is influenced by the TrackLeaveAction paramter which
 * may have these values:
 *
 *   none
 *     - Just change tracks, leave the current track in whatever
 *       mode it is in.
 *
 *   cancel
 *     - Schecule appropriate mode ending events to leave the current
 *       track in Play mode
 *
 *   cancelWait
 *     - Schedule mode ending events and wait for them to finish
 *
 * If the next track triggers EmptyTrackAction and the previous track
 * was still recording then we take the play layer rather than the 
 * record layer.  
 *
 * For all recording modes except rounding modes, cancel and cancelWait
 * behave the same.  We will always wait for the latency adjusted mode
 * ending event so that track copy works as expected.
 *
 * NOTE: We set the activeTrack flag in the Function definition to make sure
 * the event is scheduled in the active track, even if the script's
 * target track is somewhere else.
