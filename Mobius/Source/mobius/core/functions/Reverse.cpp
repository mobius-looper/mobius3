 * Reverse and related functions.
 *
 * Implmenting reverse by reversing the direction of the frame
 * counter and all of the frame calculations adds a great deal
 * of complexity and is very error prone.  Instead, we push
 * the implementation down into the Layer and Audio classes to make it behave
 * as if the frame sequence had been instantly mirrored.  We can
 * then continue to move "forward" in all of the calculations up here, 
 * though Audio will actually be applying the changes in reverse.
 * Since Audio has a relatively simple job to do, this greatly
 * reduces complexity.
 *
 * There is one thing we have to do out here though.  After
 * Audio flips the sequence of frames, we have to flip the frame
 * times of any events or transitions that had been previously calculated.
 * For example say there is a loop of 1000 frames and the record
 * frame counter is 800.  When Audio flips the processing of the
 * frames, we have to convert the frame counter of 800 to 200 since
 * instead than being 200 from the "end" we're now 800 from the
 * end going in reverse.  
 * 
 * THINK: If there are quantized events we haven't reached when we
 * go into reverse, their event frames will be reflected so we'll
 * encounter them in reverse at a different relative distance.  You'll
 * have to "loop around" once to encounter them them. Example:
 *
 * loopFrames = 8, currentFrame=2, reverseEvent = 2, otherEvent = 4
 *
 * After reflection currentFrame=5 and otherEvent=3.  If there was no
 * reverseEvent, we would have encountered otherEvent in 2 frames.  Now
 * we have to wait 6 frames since we have to loop around once.
 *
 * This may be interesting, but it isn't what you want for a pair
 * of quantized SUSReverse events.  You expect the reverse to 
 * start at the first event, and end 2 frames later.  Here you want
 * to reflect around the reverseEvent frame, maintaining the same
 * relative distance.   That seems more musically useful.
 *
 * If there are events quantized beyond the end of the loop, simple 
 * size-based reflection will result in events with negative frames that
 * will never be reached until we reverse again.  I actually sort of
 * like that, but it does conflict with reverseEvent reflection we would
 * do for other events.  This may not be an issue since reverse should
 * cancel most modes?
 * 
 * TODO: There is the notion of a long-press with ToggleReverse that
 * changes it from a toggle to a SUS toggle if the MIDI note is held down
 * long enough.
 * 
 * Only the Insert and ToggleReverse functions can be used as a Record
 * alternate ending.
