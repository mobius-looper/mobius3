 * Functions related to loop switching.
 *
 * SwitchDuration
 *
 * SWITCH_PERMANENT
 *   Stay in the next loop and let it play.
 *
 * SWITCH_ONCE
 *   Stay in the next loop, but mute it after it plays to the end.
 *
 * SWITCH_ONCE_RETURN
 *   Play the next loop to the end, then return to the original loop.
 *
 * SWITCH_SUSTAIN
 *   Stay in the next loop, but must when the trigger goes up.
 *
 * SWITCH_SUSTAIN_RETURN
 *   Play the next loop until the trigger goes up, then return
 *   to the original loop.
 *
 * 
 * SwitchDuration controls how the LoopX functions behave.
 *
 * SUSNextLoop and SUSPrevLoop always behave like SWITCH_SUSTAIN_RETURN,
 * they ignore SwitchDuration.
 * 
 * NextLoop and PrevLoop with SwitchDuration=SWITCH_SUSTAIN_RETURN is
 * identical to SUSNextLoop and SUSPrevLoop.

/**
 * Called indirectly by Event::confirm when we find a pending

 * confirming from another pending event such as RecordStopEvent.
 *
 * There are two ways we can get here.  First if you have
 * switch confirmation on, the switch event will be scheduled pending
 * and you have to confirm it by invoking the Confirm function
 * (or an alias like Undo if configured).  When this happens
 * we then schedule the switch quantized *from the point of confirmation*.
 *
 * The second way we can get here is if the switch were pending
 * waiting for a synchronized recording to complete.  You would get into this
 * state if you started a sync recording, then did a loop switch to
 * end the recording.  If we have to wait for a sync pulse, the
 * switch is marked pending and we confirm it in the RecordStopEvent handler.
 * In this case we do NOT want to quantize the switch, it should happen
 * immediately.
 * 
 * Event::confirm has these comments:
 *
 * Confirm the event on the given frame.  If frame is EVENT_FRAME_IMMEDIATE (-1)
 * the event is expected to be scheduled immediately in the target loop.
 * If the event frame is EVENT_FRAME_CALCULATED (-2) the event handler
 * is allowed to calculate the frame, though usually this will behave
 * the same as IMMEDIATE.  If the frame is positive the event is activated
 * for that frame.
 *
 * This works for our purposes the Confirm function needs to use -2
 * and RecordStopEvent needs to use -1.  Think more about this though.
 * If only Confirm needs to calculate quantization then we could just move
 * it up there and require that a frame be passed here?
 * 
 * If we're in Insert or Multiply mode, it is unclear how SwitchQuant
 * is to behave.  Options:
 *
 * - ignore it, switch immediately after the mode end event
 * - schedule mode end, then reschedule the switch afterward
 * - schedule normally, then schedule mode end, and move switch
 *   event after the mode end if it preceeds it.
 *
 * The third way seems most natural to me, so if SwitchQuant is Loop or
 * Cycle, we'll end the multiply and wait for the expected point.
