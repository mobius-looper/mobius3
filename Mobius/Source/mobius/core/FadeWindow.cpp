 * 
 * Helper class for Layer to keep track of a short segment of
 * recorded audio over which a deferred fade may need to be applied.
 *
 * UPDATE: Also now used by some Plugins to implement a shutdown fade by
 * capturing a tail window, reversing it, then fading it out.  Saves having
 * to capture a fade tail from the source material.
 *
 * When you leave overdub on and record seamlessly over the loop boundary,
 * fades at the end of the last layer and the beginning of the new layer
 * are deferred to avoid a fade bump during playback.   If you later
 * undo back to the previous layer, the deferred fade at the end
 * must be applied because the content following the end will
 * no longer exist.
 *
 * Similarly, if you overdub a section into the middle of a layer then
 * turn overdub off, the end of the overdub must be faded after
 * the fact since we couldn't anticipate when the fade would be necessary.
 *
 * These two cases present a problem when "layer flattening" is enabled
 * because the new audio is being constantly combined with feedback
 * audio being copied from the previous layer.  If we simply apply
 * a fade to the current contents of the layer, we will in effect be fading
 * not only the new overdubbed content, but also the feedback content
 * being copied from the previous layer.  If the overdub happens to be
 * silent, this will produce a click because the previous layer content
 * will fade out, then abruptly resume at its normal level.
 *
 * We must have a way to accomplish a fade of only the new overdubbed
 * content without affecting the copied content.  The simplistic approach
 * is to maintain the feedback content and the overdubbed content in
 * two different Audio objects and merge them at runtime.  This is easy
 * but potentially doubles the amount of memory required.
 *
 * A more complex approach is to maintain a short "window" contaning
 * only new overdubbed content, then perform the fade as follows:
 *
 *     - subtract the contents of the window from the combined
 *       layer content
 *
 *     - apply a fade to the contents of the window
 *
 *     - add the window with the fade back into the combined layer content
 *
 * To preserve memory, this window only needs to be as wide as the
 * maximum allowed fade range. The contents of the window will be
 * constantly shifted as recording progresses so that it always
 * contains the "tail" of the recording.  When overdub is turned
 * off, we then apply the fade as described above to the tail.
 *
 * A more obscure case happens when there is a deferred fade at the
 * beginning of the layer, and a replace is performed that occludes
 * the content at the end of the previous layer.  Since there
 * will no longer be content at the end of the loop that matches the
 * beginning of the loop, this will product a click unless we apply
 * a deferred fade to the beginning of the loop.
 *
 * Applying a fade at the beginning has the same problem as applying one
 * to the tail, the new content has been merged with feedback content copied
 * from the previous layer, so we need to maintain a window containing
 * only the new content.  Unlike the previous example, this window
 * only captures the beginning of the layer and then stops, it does not
 * "follow" the record cursor as the recording progresses.
 *
 * There are therefore two types of windows:
 *
 *   Head Window
 *     Captures a range of frames and stops when the window is full.
 *
 *   Tail Window
 *     Continually captures frames, shifting old frames out of the window
 *     to make room for new frames when it becomes full.
 *
 *
 * REVERSE
 *
 * The window is always captured "forward", the fact that it will
 * be stored in the Audio in reverse does not matter initially.  A head
 * window still behaves like a head window even if the content in the 
 * window will be at the right of the layer (reversed) rather than the left.
 *
 * Where reverse matters is when the fade is applied.  We will feed
 * the window to the AudioCursor as recorded, and the AudioCursor will
 * reverse it.  The only reverse awareness we need here is to reflect
 * the start frame of the fade before using the cursor.
 *
 * OVERLAPPING FADES AND EDGE CONDITIONS
 *
 * If an overdub is begun in the middle of the Layer, an up fade
 * is automatically applied by the AudioCursor as the content is copied
 * in to the Audio.  This processing is not howver seen by the FadeWindow
 * since we get the raw audio buffer being passed to the Layer.
 *
 * If an up fade region overlaps with a FadeWindow when the window fade is 
 * applied, we will do an incorrect subtraction of the window content
 * from the layer since a portion of the window content will be at a higher
 * level than the already faded content in the layer.  
 *
 * The chances of this are slim, but boundary scenarios are:
 *
 *  1) Deferred head fade, Overdub ends within 2 times the number of 
 *     frames in the window.  Here the head window and tail window will
 *     overlap to some degree.  The tail window fade will be applied making
 *     the content in the head window not match the Audio content.  This
 *     may cause clicks when the head window is eventually applied.
 *
 *     With the usual fade range of 128 the overdub must be turned off
 *     within 256 frames from the beginning of the layer, which is about
 *     5 milliseconds.  Difficult but not impossible if you were trying
 *     to time the ending of the overdub to the end of the layers.
 *
 *     Solution : Apply down fade to head window
 *     Here the same fade that was applied to the Audio is made to the
 *     contents of the head window.  Requires coordination between the
 *     two windows.  
 *
 * 2) No deferred head fade, overdub starts within the window.
 *    A dynamic up fade will be applied to the Audio content that
 *    will not be present in the head window content.  This is not a problem
 *    provided that we never attempt to apply a head window when there
 *    was no deferred head fade.  
 *
 * 3) Deferred head fade, overdub starts within the window.
 *    This would require that the first overdub end within the window
 *    (scenario 1) and then start again almost immediately.  Very
 *    difficult to accomplish in practice.  The head window will be
 *    modified to handle scenario 1, but it will not contain the
 *    dynamic up fade for the new overdub resulting in a level jump.
 *
 *    Solution: Perform dynamic up fades in the head window
 *    We would use an AudioFade object similar to the way AudioCursor does.
 *
 * 4) Overdub starts and ends within a window.
 *    When the overdub starts a dynamic up fade is being applied that
 *    is not present in the window.  If the overdub ends within this window,
 *    will apply a down fade to the preceeding frames and the window will
 *    not match the layer.  For this to happen you would have to begin
 *    and end an overdub in 2.5 milliseconds or less.  Very unlikely, 
 *    though concievable with SUSOverdub and a bouncy switch.
 *
 *    Solution: Perform dynamic up fades in the tail window
 *    Solution2: Quantize the end of a SUS function so that it
 *    cannot end within a certain range of the start.
 *
 * 5) Overdub starts within 2x the window size from the end of the layer.
 *    Similar to scenario 4, but the "end event" is caused by the end
 *    of the layer rather than a manual event.  Since an overdub
 *    is in progress when the layer is shifted, this will result in
 *    a deferred tail fade.  When this fade is applied, it will not
 *    contain the dynamic up fade that was in progress at the end.
 *    This is more likely since you could be timing the start of the
 *    overdub to the beginning of the loop and hit it a little early.
 * 
 *    Solution: Perform dynamic up fades in the tail window
 *
 * 6) Overdub starts less than 1x the window size from the end of the layer.
 *    Similar to scenario 5 but with the added complication that the
 *    up fade is split between the trailing and leading edge of two layers.
 *    There will be a deferred fade at the begginning of the next layer so
 *    we will capture a head window.  This window will not however contain
 *    the remainder of the up fade.
 *
 *    Solution: Perform dynamic up fades in the head window
 *    Solution: Layer must transfer dynamic up fade state from one
 *    layer to the next during a shift.
 *
 * 7) Deferred head fade, overdub ends shortly after the beginning.
 *    This is the same as 1, but split out to emphasize another complication.
 *    Down fades are applied retroactively to frames preceeding the current 
 *    frame.   If a down fade must be applied within the fade range from
 *    the beginning of a layer, it must either be truncated or caused
 *    to span the layer boundary.  For example, if an overdub ends at frame 8,
 *    the fade range logically must include the last 120 frames of the previous
 *    layer and the first 8 frames of the new layer.  If you simply truncate
 *    the range to 8 frames there may not be enough time to perform 
 *    a good sounding fade.
 *
 *    Solution: Apply down fade to head window
 *    Solution: Apply down fade to the tail window of the previous layer
 *      AND the end of the previous layer's Audio.
 * 
 * The solutions to 3, 4, 5, and 6 are basically the same.  While 3 and 4
 * could be ignored, 5 and 6 are likely to happen in practice so we can
 * solve them all with the same mechanism.
 *
 * The solution to 1 solves half of 7.  The full solution to seven requires
 * the additional application of permanent fades to the previous layer.
 * The fundamental solutions are:
 *
 *   - Apply retroactive down fade to the contents of a window
 *   - Apply dynamic up fade to the contents of a window
 *   - Apply retroactive down fade to trailing edge of previous layer
 *
 * A different approach entirely would be to use the fade windows sort
 * of like a Segment, and NOT write their content into the layer Audio
 * until they are applied.  As things spill out of the tail window, they
 * are written into the Audio, at the end of the recording we will
 * have an Audio with a "gap" on both ends with the content contained
 * in the head and tail windows.  When the layer is played, we have
 * to check to see if the requested range overlaps one of the windows
 * and selectively extract content from them.  This doesn't seem any easier
 * though and complicates saving the layer in a project since the Audio
 * doesn't have everything.
