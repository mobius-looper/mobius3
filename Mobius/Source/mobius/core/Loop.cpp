 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * Maintains the state of one loop.
 *
 * Internally each loop is made up of a list of "layers" represented
 * with Layer objects.  A layer is essentially one unique iteration
 * through the loop.  Layers are added as the loop changes, layers
 * are removed with the Undo function.
 *
 * AUTO FEEDBACK REDUCTION
 *
 * The EDP applies an automatic 5% reduction in feedback level when
 * recording new material over the previous layer (overdub, multiply, stutter).
 * When flattening is disabled this presents a problem because we cannot
 * selectively apply feedback to only the section with the overdub, it
 * must be applied to the entire layer.  If we're just playing back
 * the loop without further recording this isn't too bad, as the level
 * drop is unnoticeable and it will stay the same as we shift and reuse
 * the previous layer.  If however you are doing repeated overdubs on an
 * isolated area of the loop, you may notice the level of the entire background
 * reduce on each overdub.  
 *
 * The code is conditionalized for feedback redunction when not flattening,
 * and by default it is off.  This seems reasonable since the potential
 * overload you might have if you didn't reduce feedback normally only
 * happens after you've done a lot of overdubs, and if you're doing lots
 * of overdubs you normally want to be flattening.
 *
 * When we flatten, we can support this feature, however it presents
 * a problem for the unit tests since overdubs will record differently
 * depending on whether flattening is enabled or not.  For this we
 * provide a global paramter to enable auto feedback reduction that can be
 * turned off for testing.

 * Common Multiply/Insert end scheduling.

 * We are in Multiply or Insert mode and another function was used.
 * The event passed is the primary event for the trigger function.
 * We will schedule either MultiplyEndEvent or InsertEndEvent along
 * with a JumpPlayEvent as it's child.
 *
 * The trigger event will be ignored if it is the normal end event
 * for this mode (Multiply or Insert) or if it is one of the alternate
 * endings such as Record for Unrounded Multiply.
 *
 * If we decide to keep the trigger event, the end event will be set
 * as it's child.  
 *
 * NOTE: In retrospect, we really don't need a set of "end" event types,
 * we could just reuse the main event and check to see if we're already
 * in the mode, like we do for most other things.
 *
 * Trigger event is also ignored if we've already ended the mode and the 
 * function isn't one that increases the length of the mode or forces
 * a unrounded ending.  
 * Q: Could in theory just schedule them after the ending?
 * 
 *
 * The Action and the Event will be linked together.  If we decide
 * to ignore the event the Action must be transfered to the mode end event.
 *
 * TODO: If the multiply originated with either the
 * SUSRoundMultiply or SUSUnroundedMultiply functions, then we
 * may need to ignore Preset::isRoundOverdub here?
 * 
 * !! Need to consistently detect events that come in during a 
 * SUS operation and either ignore them, or cancel the SUS.
 * This makes it possible to have "dangling" SUS up transitions

/**
 * Calculate the ending frame of a Multiply/Insert.
 * If RoundingOverdub=Off, recording may end sooner than we end the mode.  
 *
 * The original behavior was based on a diagram in the manual that suggested
 * that Multiply/Insert always end on a cycle boundary RELATIVE TO THE
 * START OF THE MODE.  This resulted in behavior most people (including me)
 * hated which was that you would get an extra cycle added if you
 * stopped the multiply AFTER the original start point.  The original
 * start point is hard to remember so this was a common problem.
 *
 * Now, we always end the Multiply/Insert in the current cycle.
 *
 * Because I didn't like the original behavior I added 
 * MultiplyMode=Overdub which sort of works the desired way but
 * you lose the "remultiply" behavior.  Now that normal multiply
 * works better think about whether we need Overdub mode.
 * 
 * Unrounded multiply works as before, cut between the quantized or
 * unquantized record ending and the start of the mode.
 *
 * Remultiply is funny. We're supposed to maintain the cycle length
 * but if we don't extend relative to the start point the way people
 * hate there is no way to do this.
 *
 *   - loop with 2 cycles, cycle length 1000
 *   - start remultiply in cycle 2 frame 500
 *   - end remultiply in cycle 2 frame 800
 *
 * If we follow the "always end in the current cycle" rule then we have
 * to move the start of the remultiply backward to the beginning of the
 * cycle to retain the cycle length.
 * 
 * TODO: If the stop frame is within 100ms after a cycle boundary, the
 * EDP will round it down.  This helps prevent adding an unwanted
 * extra cycle if Quantize=Off and you're manually pressing buttons
 * near the end.
 * 
 * OLD NOTES
 *
 * Rather than ending on a cycle boundary relative to the start
 * of the multiply, we can simply end on the next cycle boundary.
 * I actually like this better because you have more control over
 * how many cycles you will end up with and don't have to worry
 * about where you started the multiply.
 * Actually, why not just end the multiply immediately?
 * It would end up behaving like Overdub with the ability
 * to add new cycles.  This to me seems most natural.
 * Added MULTIPLY_OVERDUB for this.
 *
 * UPDATE: In scripts it is common to call an ending function
 * on the same frame as the Insert or Multiply, the expectation
 * being that we insert/multiply exactly one cycle.  Originally
 * however, if endFrame and mModeStartFrame were the same we
 * would immediately end the mode.  I can see advantages for both
 * behaviors, an immediate end allows us to cancel an Insert after
 * a loop switch without actually inserting but there are other ways
 * to do that.

 * This is also where the logic resides to handle the pitch, rate,

 * NOTE: The latency loss correction we perform here is necessary

 * is about to change the rate.  The next event will be scheduled
 * using the current latencies, not knowing that the JumpPlayEvent
 * will soon change them.  In practice, this only happens in scripts and
 * can be avoided if you add a "Wait last" after the rate function.
 * Ideally we could look for any pending jump events on the current
 * frame when scheduling every event and factor in the latency changes.
 * But this is complicated and error prone and only relevant for obscure
 * cases in scripts.  Leave the warning in because it sometimes catches
 * real scheduling errors.

 * to start with the play transition logic in one place to better see
 * understand it.  Now that things have settled down, this needs to be

/**
 * SwitchEvent event handler.
 * 
 * This is where we actually perform the switch.  We normally will
 * have already processed a JumpPlayEvent and have begun preplay of the
 * next loop.
 *
 * This one is complicated, pay attention.
 *
 * First examine the child events attached to the SwitchEvent.
 * Some of these are considered "control" events that will cause
 * operations such as TimeCopy and SoundCopy into the next loop.
 * Others are just placeholders for events that need to be processed
 * immediately after the switch.  They are similar to pending events
 * though they are not on the master event list.
 * 
 * Anything that still remains on the master event list is transfered
 * to the next loop, possibly with frame adjustments.  This shouldn't
 * happen often, ScriptEvent is one of the rare exceptions.
 *
 * If we're restarting the same loop, then leave the events alone.
 * Hmm, this may conflict with switch behavior if LoopCount just happens
 * to be 1?
 * 
 * Originally we tried to allow normally scheduled events, including
 * those stacked on successive quantization boudaries and marked
 * for rescheduling to be passed into the next loop. We no longer support
 * this, only control events performed immediately after the switch
 * and a few special cases like ScriptEvent are allowed once the
 * switch has begun.  We could probably support that if necessary
 * but it's complicated and obscure.  But since the code was fleshed out
 * at one time, it is still there.
 * 
 * OLD COMMENTS
 *
 * Any events that remain are transfered to the next loop.
 * The first one is normally not marked for rescheduling, and we just
 * pass it over after adjusing the frame.  Remaining events should all 
 * be marked for rescheduling.  Because we didn't know what the quantization
 * boundaries would be when the reschedule events were added, they will
 * all have the switch frame.  We could be smart and reschedule them now
 * to determine their proper frame, but it's enough just to stick them 
 * all at the end of the loop and reschedule them incrementally.
 * 
 * If the next loop is empty, we won't propagate any events that need
 * rescheduling.  But if there is an event that is ready to be activated
 * it has to pass over.  This is important for SpeedEvent and ReverseEvent
 * which need to complete state transitions even if the new loop is reset.

/**
 * Helper for all forms of track copy.
 * We want the destination track to have the same frame as the source
 * track but since the event we're processing can be in the middle
 * of an interrupt block, they can be out of sync at the end
 * of the current interrupt.
 *
 * "this" loop is the Loop the event is being processed in.  It
 * will be the same as "src" for EmptyTrackAction=copy and
 * the same as "dest" for TrackCopy.
 *
 * Example 1: EmptyTrackAction, source before dest
 *
 *     Track 1: source
 *       currently at frame 100,000, offset 142 into a buffer of 256
 *
 *     Track 2: destination
 *  
 * In this example, we're a little over halfway processing our interrupt
 * buffer with 114 frames left to go.  Track 2 has not advanced at all
 * yet so it has 256 frames to go.  If we copy the source frame
 * to the destination track without adjustment, track 1 will end the
 * interrupt on frame 100,114 and track 2 will end on frame 100,256.
 * To make them align, the destination frame is calculated as:
 *
 *      destFrame = sourceFrame - sourceAdvance
 *
 * In this example 99858.  When the destination track advances 256
 * it also ends up at 99858 + 256 = 100114.
 *
 * Example 2: EmptyTrackAction, dest before source
 *
 *   Track 1: destination
 *   Track 2: source, frame 100,000, offset 142, buffer 256
 * 
 * The destination track has already fully advanced in this interrupt.
 * The source track has 114 frames remaining.  Without adjustment
 * at the end of the interrupt track 1 would be at frame 100,000
 * and track 2 would be at 100,114.  The adjustment is:
 *
 *       destFrame = sourceFrame + sourceRemaining
 *
 * In this example 100,000 + 114.
 *
 * Example 3: TrackCopy, source before dest
 *
 * With the TrackCopy functions are are "in" the destination track.
 *
 *   Track 1: source, frame 100,000
 *   Track 2: dest, frame 50,000, offset 142, buffer 256
 *
 * The source track has finished advancing, the destination track
 * has 114 frames remaining.  The adjustment is:
 *
 *    destFrame = sourceFrame - destRemaining
 *
 * Example 3: TrackCopy, dest after source
 * 
 *   Track 1: dest, frame 50,000, offset 142, buffer 256
 *   Track 2: source, frame 100,000
 *
 * At the end of the interrupt track 2 will be at 100,256.
 * The adjustment is:
 *
 *     destFrame = sourceFrame + destAdvance
 *
 * In this examle, 100,142 plus the final advance of 114 brings 
 * track 1 to 100,256.
 *
 * As usual rate shift complicates this.
 *
 * If we can assume that the rate shift is the same in both
 * tracks, then the remainder or advance adjustment 
 * is simply multipled by the rate of the source track.
 * In example 4 if both tracks were in 1/2 speed, the
 * effective buffer size would be 128, the ending frame
 * for track 2 will be 100,128 and destAdvance would be 71
 * so 100,000 + 71 (destAdvance) + 57 (destRemaining) = 100,128.
 * 
 * If the rates are different it is more complicated.
 * If the source is in 1/2 speed and the destination is in 
 * full speed, we could handle this several ways.
 *
 *    - copy the entire unadjusted source track, it will sound
 *      twice as long as the source track
 *
 *    - copy the rate adjusted source track, it will sound
 *      the same size until the source track unshifts
 *
 *
 * UPDATE:
 *
 * Well that's all well and good, but there is another complication
 * that can be seen if you switch during recording.  The switch happens
 * immediately after the recording of the current track is closed
 * which leave the source frame at zero.  In this case for example 1 the
 * frame will be negative.  We wrap it back to a little before the end
 * of the loop.  Now if TimeCopyMode is Multiply or Insert we have a problem
 * because we immediately see a crossing of the loop boundary which
 * adds another cycle.  
 *
 * What we really need to calculate here is two frames.  The first the
 * starting frame the loop would have if it had always been the size
 * of the copied loop, and the second the frame that the TimeCopyMode
 * change should occur, this will be exactly the same as the offset
 * into the original buffer that the track select event happened on.
 * So for example 1:
 *
 *    startFrame = sourceFrame - sourceAdvance
 *    modeSwitchFrame = sourceFrame
 *
 * In any of the other examples where the dest frame is after the sourceFrame
 * we have a problem.  Ideally we would have started the mode exactly on 
 * the sourceFrame but since that buffer has been fully advanced now, we can't
 * easilly go back in time and insert a bit of recording into the previous
 * tracks.  In these cases the Overdub/Multiply/Insert will start a little
 * late but since the loops are least the same size it won't be that bad. 
 * They still be aligned, we must might shave a very small bit off the front.

 * Helper for MidiStartEvent and RealignEvent.
 * For the special functions that enter Mute mode waiting for
 * a sync pulse, we have the possibility of the pulse comming in
 * before we get to the scheduled mute event.  This happens often
 * when RealignTime=Immediate, but can happen in any of the other
 * modes if we schedule very near the next clock pulse.
 *
 * Have to look for an upcomming MuteEvent and remove it.
 * 
 * Tried to avoid this by doing an immediate mute without schedulign an event,
 * but MuteEvent triggers all the other return/rehearse/record unwinding 
 * logic that we still need.
 * !! Revisit this, the MuteRealign scheduler could stop record modes too.
