 * 
 * An object that tracks synchronization pulses comming from
 * an external sync source, compares those to the rate of advancement
 * in the audio stream, and calculates the amount of drift.
 * 
 * One of these is maintained by Synchronizer for each of the sync
 * sources: Host Beats, MIDI Clocks, and the Timer used to generate
 * output MIDI clocks.
 *
 * A sync tracker can be in two states: "unlocked" and "locked".
 * 
 * Unlocked means that the tracker is simply counting pulses and does know
 * the length of the external sync loop.  Sync trackers will remain
 * unlocked until a Mobius track is recorded using that tracker.  
 *
 * Locked means that the size of the sync loop has been established
 * and the tracker is now able to compare the rate of advancemenet of the
 * sync pulses with the rate of advancement of the audio stream.  A
 * tracker is locked the moment a Mobius track is recorded using that trakcer.
 * Once locked, most trackers will continue using the size of the original
 * sync loop even if the Mobius loop changes size or is reset.  This
 * allows the Mobius loops to go wildly out of alignment, while still
 * tracking sync drift (see manual for a discussion on the difference
 * between "drift" and "dealign").
 *
 * A tracker will move from the locked to unlocked state when all Mobius
 * tracks that use this tracker are reset.  
 *
 * When a tracker is locked, it will begin generating it's own sync
 * events for beats and bars that exactly match the advance in the audio stream.  
 * These are the events that the Mobius tracks will follow and they may
 * not exactly match the real events being received.  This is how we can
 * keep multiple tracks in perfect sync, following a locked tracker is
 * similar to following a Track Sync master, it is immune to jitter in the
 * external pulses.  When we detect drift, all tracks following this
 * tracker are adjusted an identical amount.
 *
 * It is important that the performer think about the size of the first
 * loop recorded with this tracker because this will determine the
 * sync loop size for all tracks for the duration of the performance.
 * If it is necessary to change the size of the sync loop after it has been
 * locked, you muse use the SetSyncLoop function or set the system variables
 * hostSyncLoopPulses, midiSyncLoopPulses, and outSyncLoopPulses.
 *
 * The tracker for output MIDI clocks is unlike the others because it
 * can change size to adapt to changes in the Mobius loop size when
 * SyncAdjust=SYNC_ADJUST_TEMPO.  The tempo of the generated clocks
 * will raise or lower which may cause the number of pulses to change.
 * The length of the tracked audio loop will also change to correspond
 * to the new pulse width.  
 * 
 * There are two places where drift can be checked, defined by the
 * DriftCheckPoint global parameter.  DRIFT_CHECK_LOOP will make the
 * drift check when the Mobius loop crosses the start point within an 
 * audio interrupt.  DRIFT_CHECK_EXTERNAL will make the check when the
 * tracker pulse counter wraps back to zero which is called the
 * "external start point".  
 *
 * Note that DRIFT_CHECK_LOOP only makes sense if the number of pulses
 * in the tracker is large.  Because pulses are relatively coarse, checking
 * drift when at a specific Mobius loop location can show an error of one
 * full pulse width.  For example a loop with 100,000 frames and 4 pulses.
 * When the Mobius loop is at the start point, the ideal pulse will be 0.
 * But if the pulse is just slightly late the corresponding pulse frame
 * would be 75,000 resulting in a drift of 25,000 which looks very bad except
 * that a millisecond later when the pulse comes in the pulse frame jumps
 * to 100,000.
 *
 * This extreme example is possible when using Host sync, since 
 * beat pulses from the host can be relatively large.  It is less of a problem
 * for MIDI in/out sync since pulses are MIDI clocks which occur 24 times
 * per beat.  For a modest tempo of 60 bpm, that would be 24 clocks per
 * second.  At the usual sample rate of 44100 samples per second, the
 * pulse width would be 1837.5 which is the margin of error at any
 * given internal loop location.  The recommend drift correction threshold is
 * 4096 so this is within tolerance, still the effective tolerance is
 * almost half that due to the margin of error.
 *
 * This margin of error can also effect drift correction.  If drift
 * correction is not done exactly on a sync pulse, the true location
 * of the external loop will be somewhere between two pulses.  But since
 * we can't know that, we would have to round up or down.  In the first 
 * extreme case, if we noticed a drift of 25,000 at the loop start point
 * and corrected that by jumping to frame 75,000, on the next pulse we
 * would be lagging the external loop by up to 25,000 frames.  
 *
 * What all this means is that drift can only be calculated when pulses
 * are received.  Drift is then effectively locked until the next pulse.
 * We do not allow drift correction between pulses, but if we did
 * we would use the drift from the last pulse.  Usually this is still
 * close to the actual drift, but if the clock is changing tempo we
 * may lag a bit.  But since we don't attempt to follow external tempo 
 * changes this is not a problem.
 *
 * PULSE WIDTH JITTER
 *
 * Trackers will generate pulse events on beat/bar boundaries but not clocks
 * (for MIDI, OUT).  We try to size the initial loop so that the beat
 * width is an integer but that isn't always possible.  If the beat width
 * is not an iteer this may results in jitter in the beat sizes.  The relative
 * importance of this error depends on the loop length and the number of beats.
 * 
 * For an extreme example assume the loop length is 10 and the beat count
 * is 6.  The beat width is 1.66r
 *
 * The truncated frames for each beat origin are: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10
 * Which makes the beat widths 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2
 *
 * In real-world loops with thousands of frames the magnitude of the error 
 * becomes less but the jitter can still cause errors.  For a loop of 10000
 * frames and 6 pulses the beat origins are: 0, 1666, 3333, 5000, 6666,
 * 8333, 10000.
 *
 * The beat widths are 1666, 1667, 1667, 1666, 1667, 1667.
 *
 * The relative error is small but depending on where you start and end you
 * can end up with slave tracks that are not the same size and will drift 
 * apart over time.  We have the same problem with Track Sync on subcycles.
 *
 * When generating tracker events however we don't maintain a float pulse frame
 * counter that increments each advance.  We could, but it's extra work and
 * it isn't necessary.  Instead for each audio interrupt we start from
 * mAudioFrame and try to determine which pulse we're "in".  We do this by
 * dividing the frame number by the pulse width.  This results in a different
 * rounding error.  When accumulating from the beginning the second pulse
 * would begin on frame 1666, the third on 3333, etc.  But when working
 * back from the frame to the pulse 1666 divided by 1.66r is 0.996 which
 * rounds down to zero instead of 1.  It won't be until frame 1667 that
 * we think we've entered the second pulse.  So when calculating pulses
 * from frames the effective pulse origins are:
 *
 *     0, 1667, 3334, 5000, 6667, 8334, 10000
 *
 * with effective beat widths of:
 *
 *     1667, 1667, 1666, 1667, 1667, 1666
 *
 * The pattern is the same as before, just shifted one the left.
 *
 * Note though that is is not guaranteed that the final frame will 
 * divide cleanly into the final pulse.  With this example 10000 divided
 * by 1.66r (on my PC calculator anyway) was a nice round 6 but 
 * I'm not convinced that for some combinations on some architectures the
 * result would be lose but less, for example 5.9999999999.
 * 
 * This isn't so bad since we'll detect the pulse one frame late, but I like
 * to have the start frame be always accurate so slave tracks can follow
 * it and always get the same result.  We can remove this error by adding
 * some noise like .1 before we divide.  But this also feels dirty.  I can't 
 * convince myself that this won't result in missed beats, though the 
 * width between the beats would have to be very, very small.
 *
 * I'm going to leave the interior beats with the second kind of roundoff
 * error and add  a check to ensure that when we cross the loop start
 * point that we generate a start point beat even if the accumulated pulse
 * frame is not quite there.
 *
 * Recording while speed adjusted can throw another wrench into this.
 * I can't even think about that now..
 * 
 * WHY I HATE FLOATING POINT (more pulse detection)
 *
 * We have another complication when pulses fall on the first frame
 * of an audio buffer.
 * 
 * Assume loop length is 88200, 96 MIDI clock pulses, 24 clocks per beat, 
 * 22050 frames per beat 918.75 pulse frames.  Assume buffer stream 
 * where buffer starts at frame 21922 and is 128 frames long.
 * Note that we don't actually reach the beat boundary in this buffer, 
 * we get to frame 21049.  The final frame in the buffer is the last
 * frame in beat zero.  The first frame in the next buffer will be 22050, 
 * the start of beat one.
 *
 * At the beginning of buffer 21922 we have to determine which pulse we're
 * in so we can calculate the beginning of the next pulse.  Most of the time
 * you can do this by dividing the origin frame 21922 by pulse frames.
 * 21922 / 918.75 is 23.86 so we are near the end of beat 23.
 * To find the start of the next pulse we add 1 to get 24 and multiply by
 * pulseFrames 918.75 * 24 = 22050.  The buffer contains frames 21922 
 * through 21049 so the next beat is not within this buffer.
 *
 * Now we get to buffer 22050, dividing by 918.75 we get 24.  The problem here
 * is that we are exactly at the start of the beat, normally we would now
 * see if beat 24+1 starts in this buffer.  We can't tell the difference
 * between "beat started in a previous buffer" and "beat started at the
 * beginning of this buffer" with just with a division.  
 *
 * Now you're thinking: use modulo.  If the origin frame 22050 modulo
 * 918.75 is zero, then we knwow we're exactly at the start of the beat
 * and don't have to look for the beginning of the next one.  The problem is 
 * you can't trust modulo.  If the pulse or beat width is not an integer,
 * beats in the float world may not fall exactly on a frame, they may be
 * "between" frames.  
 *
 * For example, assume a pulse width of 919.20, something you commonly see
 * when trying to sync to a jittery MIDI clock at 120 BPM. Ideal pulse width
 * would be 918.75 but you don't always get there.  With that pulse width, 
 * pulse 56 occurs on frame 51475.5.  If you got a buffer beginning with
 * frame 51475 the modulo result would be 55.99782.. a buffer beginning
 * with frame 512476 the result would be 56.00870, neither of which are
 * zero.  So a single modulo can't be used for pulse detection.
 *
 * I tried two approaches, both using a simple divide with truncation
 * to determine the current pulse.  In the first approach, at the
 * beginning of the buffer, make two calculations.  One the pulse number
 * of the frame at the start of the buffer and another for the pulse
 * number of the frame immediately preceeding the start of the buffer.
 * If these two numbers differ you know you've crossed a pulse boundary
 * on this buffer.
 *
 * For 80,000 frames 96 pulses has a pulse frame of 833.33r.  Beats wil be at 
 * frame offsets 0, 20000, 60000, 80000.  We're in buffer 19872 which
 * is the last buffer in beat zero (pulse 23) the next one will be 20000
 * the start of pulse 24 beat 1.  19872 / 833.333 = 23.8 or pulse 23 which
 * is correct.  When we get to buffer 20000 make two calculations:
 *
 *     (20000 - 1) / 833.333r = 23.998
 *     20000 / 833.333r = 24
 *
 * Since the previous frame beat was one less than the current frame beat
 * we know we're at the start of a new beat, not in the middle of beat 24.  
 * If there is float rounding error it will be either too high or low.
 * If too high, say 24.0000000000000001 it truncates to 24 and we can still see 
 * the beat changed.  If the result was too low say 23.999999999999999 
 * we'll use 23 as a basis but detect the beat crossing within this
 * buffer.  We can be one off in either direction but we still
 * detect the beat which is the most important thing.
 * 
 * LOOP ROUNDING
 * 
 * Ideally, we should round the tracker loop length so that the smallest
 * granule we want to let slaves follow (clock, beat, bar) is an integer
 * number of frames.  This would ensure that tracks that slave to this
 * tracker would stay in sync, but the adjustment may put the tracker
 * out of ideal sync with the external clock.  This would cause everything
 * to drift away but at least they can all be drift corrected and stay
 * in perfect sync relative to each other.
 *
 * For the 10000 loop of 6 pulses, the adjusted size would be 9996.
 * The ideal length will be calculated by SyncTracker::prepare but
 * Synchronizer is not required to obey that.

/**
 * Called to end the recording of the first loop to use this sync tracker.
 * The size of the audio loop is passed, normally Mobius should round
 * this up to be an even number.  The number of expected sync pulses in
 * the loop is also passed.
 * 
 * The Mobius loop that caused this is expected to be exactly at
 * it's start/end point.  The tracker is also initiailzied to be at
 * it's start point.  
 *
 * TODO: With a little more work we should be able to close the tracker
 * early and let it start tracking before we actually finish the initial
 * recording.  That might be interesting for example if you wanted
 * to use AutoRecrord to record several bars, but lock the tracker as
 * soon as the first bar was received.  I can't think of a really 
 * compelling reason for that though.  This would avoid the
 * mPendingPulses complication but would make it harder to extend
 * the tracker if they change the length of the auto or sync'd recording.
 *
 * For Out sync, the MidiTimer wasn't running so we were not accumulating
 * pulses.  mPulse is zero, Just take what we are given and lock the tracker.
 *
 * For Host sync, this should be immeidately after a pulse was received
 * and there can only be one pulse per block since pulses are beats
 * which are large.  mPulse should equal the new pulse count. 
 * Take what we are given and lock the tracker.
 *
 * MIDI tracking is more complicated.  
 * 
 * First the SyncTracker consumes all pulses in an interrupt up front,
 * then Synchronizer sends them to the Tracks one at a time.  If two
 * pulses come in it is possible that recording could stop on
 * pulse 1 and the second pulse is considered a "play" pulse.  In this
 * case the passed number of pulses will be one less than mPulse.
 * This is rare since only MIDI clocks at a very high tempo can generate
 * more than one pulse per interrupt block.
 * 
 * A more common situation for MIDI sync is that the tracker is not 
 * locked exactly on a pulse.   If the midiRecordPulsed parameter is
 * set, then we will be exactly on a clock pulse but this is no longer
 * used.  Instead we adjust for clock jitter by calculating the ideal
 * loop length from the smoothed clock tempo and scheduling an event
 * for that length.  The tracker will then be locked either slightly
 * before or slightly after the final pulse.
 * 
 * If the lock event is before the final pulse, the "pulses" argument
 * will usually be one greater than mPulse since we haven't received
 * the final pulse yet.  The one exception is if there is more than one
 * pulse in the interrupt so mPulse advanced twice which is rare.
 * When mPulse is less than "pulses" we have to ignore the next
 * pulse event because we're logically including it when the tracker
 * is locked.  This is indicated by setting mPendingPulses.
 *
 * If the lock event is after the final pulse, usually "pulses" and
 * mPulse will be the same unless pulses are very close together and
 * we received another while rounding the loop length.  
 * When mPulse is greater than "pulses" the extra pulses must 
 * carrry over and become play pulses after the tracker is locked.
