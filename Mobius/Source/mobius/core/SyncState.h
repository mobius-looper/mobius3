 * Various state related to synchronization maintained on each Track.
 * These could just go on Track, but there are a lot of them and I
 * like making the relationship clearer.
 * 
 * The fields that define how sync will be performed are taken
 * from the Setup, the SetupTrack, and in a few cases the Preset.  
 * These are all gathered into one place so Synchronzer doesn't have
 * to hunt for them.  Once the first loop in a track is recorded,
 * the SyncState is "locked" and will no longer track changes to the 
 * sync configuration.  When all loops in the track are reset, the
 * SyncState is unlocked and we'll refresh the parameters from the Setup.
