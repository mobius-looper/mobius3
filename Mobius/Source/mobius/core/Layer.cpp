 * 
 * A model for a segment of audio.  The Loop class  deals with Layers, 
 * Layers in turn manage the actual audio memory model.
 *
 * MEMORY MODEL
 * 
 * In the simplest case, the Layer contains an Audio object that completely
 * defines its content.  In complex cases, a Layer will also reference
 * one or more "backing" layers that are combined with any local Audio
 * at runtime.   Backing layers are referenced through Segment objects,
 * a layer may have more than one segment, and a segment may reference
 * any portion of the backing layer.  
 *
 * Originally, Segments were used to to merge the entire layer list
 * at runtime, with feedback also applied at runtime.  This can result in 
 * effecient memory allocation since we do not have to copy the entire
 * contents of one layer to another, but it increases CPU demands as the
 * layer list grows.  After about 20 layers we often would miss interrupts
 * and cause clicks.
 *
 * Applying feedback to the entire layer at runtime also meant that we
 * could not record continuous feedback changes into the layer, the
 * feedback applied would be whatever the last value was when the layer
 * was shifted.
 *
 * To avoid runtime merging of the layers, we have to incrementally
 * "flatten" them as we record a new layer, which also allows us to apply
 * continuous feedback changes.  Segments are still used as a temporary
 * model for what the backing content since it will take too long to
 * stop and copy the entire layer when it is shifted.  Copying the backing
 * content happens incrementally as the layer is recorded.  Once recording
 * of the layer has completed, the backing layer will have been copied
 * to a local Audio object and the Segments are no longer necessary.
 *
 * An interesting problem arises when you perform a retriggering operation 
 * in the middle of the new layer.  Since copying the backing layer happens
 * incrementally as we record, we will not have completed the copy before 
 * we have to switch to a different loop.  For example:
 *
 *   1) record an initial layer
 *   2) begin overdubbing into a second layer
 *   3) perform an unquantized switch to another loop
 *   4) switch back to the original loop
 *
 * In step 3 we have to leave the current layer before we have made
 * a complete record/copy pass.  When we return in step 4, we have
 * to remember where the copy ended so we know whether we can resume
 * playback from the local Audio or whether we have to use the Segments.
 * 
 * A question I have is what feedback level is applied to that portion
 * of the layer that we did not copy in realtime?  
 * 
 *    1) the feedback level in effect when we left the layer
 *    2) the current feedback level
 *    3) 100%
 *
 * It seems to make the most sense to use 1, behaving as if the remainder
 * of the layer was instantaly copied at the feedback level at that time.
 * Number 2 could produce a sharp jump in level if you didn't remember
 * to return the feedback control to the previous position when you returned.
 *
 * A similar problem happens when we return to the loop in step 4.
 * If SwitchLocation=Restore, we're supposed to pick up where we left off.
 * But the layer we were recording has now been shifted and we begin
 * recording into a new layer in the middle.  What feedback should
 * be applied to the first half of the layer that we didn't actually
 * record over?  
 *
 * Here Number 2, the current feedback level makes sense.  It's as if
 * we had instantly copied the first half of the layer before beginning
 * to record new material in the middle.  The feedback levels should be
 * the same to avoid a sharp jump.
 * 
 * So far, all we need to maintain is a pair of "watermarks" for the
 * beginning and end of the of the region that we have copied
 * into the local Audio.  When playing in this region everything
 * we need is in the local Audio and we can ignore Segments.  Outside
 * this region we still use segments.
 * 
 * An uglier problems arises if we allow recording into the layer
 * to be non-contiguous, meaning we can recorded for awhile, then 
 * jump ahead and record into another section of the layer with a gap
 * in between.  In that case we cannot use a simple watermark, we would
 * have to continually adjust the Segments so that they do not occlude
 * the local Audio, then merge the Segments with the Audio during playback
 * rather than preferring one or the other.  If we can perform a seamless
 * recording from beginning to end, all of the segments would collapse
 * to nothing and be removed.  
 *
 * While not particularly difficult to do, that problem only arises if we
 * allow a loop switch or restart to return to the partially recorded
 * layer without shifting it.  If we shift it, we'll start over with
 * a new layer that references the previous layer with a Segment, and we'll
 * begin a new contiguous recording in the middle.  
 *
 * The work involved to maintain a pair of watermarks that occlude 
 * the Segments is not that much less difficult than just continuously
 * adjusting the segments so that they don't occlude the Audio.  On playback
 * we can then simply merge the Audio and Segments if they exist.  This
 * is the most flexible solution and may be useful for other things later.
 *
 * CURSORS
 *
 * A cursor maintains cached buffer locations inside an Audio object.
 * Each layer contains several cursors:
 *
 *   Play Cursor
 *     Used when retrieving the layer content for playback.
 *     If layer flattening is off, this will be used all the time.
 *     If flattening is on, this will never be used after the layer
 *     has shifted.
 * 
 *   CopyCursor
 *     Used when copying the layer content into the next layer.
 *     Used only during flattening of the next to last layer.
 *     Once the copy has been performed, this cursor is no longer used.
 * 
 *   RecordCursor
 *     Used during the initial recording of a layer.  Most of the time
 *     The Record Cursor and the Play Cursor will not be active at the
 *     same time, but there is a small window at the end where we begin
 *     preplay of the record layer due to latency when they will both
 *     be active.  Once the layer has shifted this is no longer used.
 *
 *   FeedbackCursor
 *     When layer flattening is on, maintains the position in the
 *     current recording layer where the content from the previous layer
 *     is copied.  Will have the same ending position as RecordCursor, 
 *     but they advance at different times.
 *
 * ISOLATED OVERDUBS
 *
 * One thing that was nice about the original memory model was that
 * the local layer Audio contained only new content that was overdubbed
 * over the the backing layer.  These could be saved as individual files
 * in the project and then mixed together creatively, effectively allowing
 * you to randomze the over of the overdubs.
 *
 * In the new model local Audio contains both the new overdubs and a copy
 * of the backing layer.  To support the old behavior, we allow an option
 * to be set to also maintain a second Audio object that has just
 * the new material.  This will up to twice the amount of memory so
 * it should be used with care.
 * 
 * FEEDBACK SMOOTHING
 *
 * Track uses ContinuousController objects to smooth out changes
 * to the various levels.  But within a layer there is an additional
 * smoothing problem that occurs whenever you enter or leave a mode
 * that uses the secondary feedback level.  In the extreme case, feedback
 * is 127, secondary feedback is 0, and the result is similar to Replace
 * mode where none of the backing layer is copied.  Simply jumping from 127
 * to zero will cause a "cliff" in the waveform which will be heard
 * as a click.
 *
 * We need to perform a gradual change in feedback, similar to what
 * ContinuousController does, but more rapidly.  The result is quite similar
 * to a fade but the curve will be linear rather than exponential.  I'd
 * like to see if level changes can be integrated into the fade logic but
 * it was more complicated than I wanted to tackle.  Instead, we'll maintain
 * the last feedback level that was applied to this layer.  On the next
 * advance, we'll compare the new feedback level to the last one and if
 * different enter a loop where the backing layer is copied in short sections
 * rather than all at once, with the feedback changing slightly for each
 * section.  
 *
 * It seems like we should be able to generalize level smoothing into
 * something that the Stream manages like it does fades.  But the current
 * approach sounds ok and is relatively simple.
 *
 * It may also be nice if the duration of the feedback ramp could be 
 * set by the global FadeFrames parameter so that they sound similar.
 *
 * REVERSE HANDLING
 *
 * This is where the rubber meets the road regarding reverse handling.
 * Code above this except for a few places in Loop related to event
 * scheduling are not aware of reverse, all calculations are done "forward".
 * Layer takes the frames passed down from Loop and "reflects" them
 * so that they are in the correct reverse position, and sets the
 * reverse flag in the AudioCursor so the cursor moves backward rather
 * than forward.  There are two reflection concepts:
 *
 * Reflected Frame
 *
 * A reflected frame is what the forward frame number would be if the layer
 * had actually been playing from the end rather than the front.  It is 
 * calculated as:
 * 
 *     reflectedFrame = (layerFrames - forwardFrame - 1);
 *
 * For example in a layer that is 10 frames long, frame 2 would become
 * reflected frame 7 because 7 is the same distance from the end of
 * the layer as 2 is from the front.
 *
 *     ..2....7..
 *
 * A subtlety is that the reflection of the "loop frame" which is
 * one beyond the end of the loop is -1 which is one beyond the front
 * of the loop.  This is handled by AudioCursor and does not affect the
 * calculations here.
 *
 * Reflected Region
 *
 * Most layer operations involve "regions" which is a block of frames
 * of a specified length starting at a specified frame.  Here is a region
 * 4 frames long starting at frame 2.  The end frame of the region is 5.
 *
 *     ..>>>>....
 *
 * In reverse, the entire region must be reflected.  The start frame
 * becomes 7 and the end frame becomes 4.
 *
 *     ....<<<<..
 *
 * For some operations, it is enough just to reflect the start frame,
 * set the AudioCursor to reverse, and move backwards 4 frames without
 * calculating the end frame.  For segment operations though, it is more
 * convenient to deal with a startFrame & length defining a forward region.
 * In those cases, we swap the reflected start and end frames.  In the
 * previous example the start frame becomes 5 and the end frame is 7.
 * This is called a "reflected region".  Methods that take a frame and length
 * need to know if they are dealing with a reflected region so they 
 * do not attemt to reflect the region edges.  The methods must also
 * remember that that the content of the reflected region must be processed in 
 * reverse, even though they are given a normal forward region.
 *
 * Reverse: Play
 *
 * Reflect the startFrame, set AudioCursor to reverse and retrieve from
 * the local Audio.  When processing the segments, reflect the region
 * and pass the region startFrame to Segment.  Segment knows to process
 * the region in reverse.
 * 
 * Reverse: PlayFadeIn
 *
 * This one is funny because we don't actually reflect the fade region.
 * What we're supposed to do is fade in whatever we return from the get()
 * method.  get() will return reflected content, all we need to do is apply
 * a forward fade to that.
 *
 * Reverse: Record
 *
 * Reflect the startFrame, set AudioCursor to reverse and write into
 * the local Audio.
 *
 * Reverse: RecordFadeIn
 * 
 * REVERSE RECORD SUBTLETY
 *
 * When we do normal forward recording, we keep appending
 * frames to the Audio object, the base frame stays the same
 * and the frame counter is incremented.  When we do reverse recording,
 * we prepend frames and shift the base frame down.
 *
 * When we end a recording with Reverse, we call setLoopFrames
 * to set the layer's frame count, then start requesting frames from
 * the end of the layer.  But due to input latency, we won't actually
 * have received all of them yet so Audio's frame counter will be less
 * than the Layer's frame counter.  
 * 
 * For example with a 10000 frame layer, with an output latency of 1000, 
 * begin reverse play at frame 8999.  With an input latency of 100, 
 * Audio will only be 9900 long.  When going from forward to reverse, 
 * this is ok as long as OutputLatency is greater than InputLatency.  
 * If InputLatency is less, we'll start playing in the empty space that
 * hasn't been recorded yet, and our fade in may be finished by the time
 * we slam into the real frames, resulting in a click.  This could be 
 * solved by deferring the onset of the fade, but in practice shouldn't
 * be an issue because OL is always greater than IL.
 *
 * If we're going from reverse to forward, it's more complicated.
 * Normal recording keeps Audio's start frame constant and increments
 * the length.  Reverse recording shifts the start frame lower.  This
 * means that there will never be empty space at the beginning of the loop,
 * there is always a frame zero and it keeps shifting.  This screws up
 * the play location.  For example a 10000 frame layer with IL of 100,
 * Audio will be 99900 long and we want to begin playing at a reflected
 * frame of 1000.  Audio has a frame 1000, but this is actually frame 1100
 * of the fully recorded layer because we're missing 100 frames from the
 * front of the Audio.  We need to start play on Audio's frame 900 instead.
 *
 * A similar issue exists when we start recording in reverse, and stay
 * in reverse.  When the loop length is known, we start preplay at OL
 * which when reflected will be 8999.  But this will be located relative
 * to a base that hasn't been fully shifted yet, the accurate Audio
 * frame would be 8999 - 100 = 8899.  
 *
 * Note that in order to make the compensating calculations, when frames
 * are requested, we have to know which direction the loop is being
 * recorded in, in addition to the play direction.  The matrix is:
 *
 *    record forward, play forward : no adjustment
 *    record forward, play reverse : no adjustment
 *    record reverse, play forward : adjustment
 *    record reverse, play reverse : adjustment
 * 
 * To avoid all of this, once we know the loop frame count, we will
 * modify Audio to have this count so that the Audio and the Layer
 * will be the same size.  How this is done also depends on the record
 * direction.  For forward recording, we simply set the frame count.
 * For reverse recording, we have to shift the base frame.  This works
 * provided that the record direction can't be changed once the
 * loop frames are set.

/*
 * There are two forms of fade during recording, an up fade performed when 
 * a new recording starts, and a down fade performed when a recording ends.
 * 
 * Up fades are performed "dynamically" by modifying samples as they
 * are received, and before they are stored in the Audio.  This happens
 * in the AudioCursor as a block of frames from the interrupt  handler
 * is put into the Audio.
 *
 * Down fades are performed "retroactively" by modifying samples
 * that have already been received and stored in the Audio.  It would
 * be possible to perform down fades dynamically in some cases, but
 * it is difficult.  Events would have to be scheduled to start the fade
 * in advance of the record ending, and during the fade the ending
 * could be canceled which would require that the fade be undone.
 * It is much much easier to wait until we're absolutely sure that the
 * fade is necessary and apply it retroactively.  The fade is performed
 * by Audio which uses an internal AudioCursor for retroactive fades.
 * 
 * There is support in the AudioFade object to "schedule" fades
 * to commence on a particular frame.  This is no longer used.
 * Dynamic up fades always start immediately with the next block
 * of frames stored in to the layer, and down fades are always performed
 * immediately on content already in the layer.
 *
 * During playback of a finished layer, there is only one kind of fade
 * at this level, a dynamic up fade used when playback resumes in the middle
 * of the layer.  This is handled by a local AudioFade object maintained
 * in each Layer.  It cannot be done in the AudioCursor as we do for
 * recording because the fade must be applied not only to the contents
 * of the local audio but to the content contributed by the segments as well.
 *
 * During recording we automatically detect when up and down fades
 * are necessary.  This assumes that recording will always proceed
 * seamlessly from beginning to end, you cannot jump around.  The need
 * for a leading edge fade is determined by looking for a trailing
 * edge fade in the previous layer.  The one case where we need
 * assistance from outside is when the layer is finalized before shifting.
 * At this level we cannot know if recording will proceed seamlessly into the
 * next layer so this must be passed down.

 * Assume we don't need to be affected by reverse, we're returning the true

 *
 * Be careful not to use the playback cursor because we could

 *
 * Note that the size of the buffer must be the same as that used
 * by the audio interrupt, the fade code in Segment::get depends
 * on this so it can allocate a stack buffer.
 *
 * This is usually being run from a KernelEvent handler in the maintenance
 * thread, in theory there can be concurrency issues with the audio thread
 * but the play layer shouldn't be modified.  
 * !! Hmm, we really can't assume that, several functions could
 * cause the play layer to be modified including Reset.  You have
 * to be careful to wait a bit after using the Save Loop function
 * before resetting the loop!
 *
 * todo: State saves on the live engine are problematic and the problem
 * is way worse for Projects.  The audio thread can't be in the business
 * of allocating large amounts of memory.  I suppose if we use the
 * same AudioPool, then the buffers at least won't be dynamic, but we would
 * have to make sure Audio, AudioCursor, and other thigns are pooled as well,
 * which you probably have to do anyway.
 *
 * But even if everything is pooled, this much copying could cause a glitch
 * in the audio stream.  That's not so bad for loop/project saves since you
 * don't generally do those while performing, still I suppose we could enter
 * some kind of mute state, but that doesn't help other plugins running in the host.
 *
 * I think the best approach is probably to put the engine in some sort of "lock"
 * state, where the maintenance thread is allowed to reach down and touch kernel
 * structures without them getting messed up by the audio thread.  At the least this
 * means no Functions can be processed, ESPECIALLY Reset.  But it's going to be
 * hard to ensure that just sitting there playing a loop won't alter something that
 * is in the process of being saved.  The most reliable would be to just disable
 * processing of audio blocks entirely while the save takes place, but this would cause
 * a major disruption of the audio stream, sort of like GlobalPause which has to do
 * edge fades when it starts and when it resumes to avoid clicks.

/**
 * Helper for Replace mode (feedback == 0) and incremental flattening.
 * Restructure the segment list to occlude a region of continguous
 * frames.  startFrame & frames must already be a reflected *region* if
 * we're in reverse.
 *
 * The "seamless" flag will be true if content from the
 * segments being occluded has been copied into our local Audio.  When
 * that happens we record the amount in the segment so we know that
 * we don't need a fade on that edge since the local audio will
 * have the correct adjacent content.
 * 
 * I considered allowing the occlusion level to be variable, by setting
 * feedback levels on the Segments, but this gets really complicated and
 * results in unwanted fades between adjacent segments that were created
 * only to have different feedback levels.  It will result in
 * memory churn since we'll be constantly carving out the front of a segment
 * on each audio interrupt to change its level, if we're not also careful
 * to congeal adjacent segments with the same level.
 * 
 * This is really only necessry to occlude a block of frames in Replace
 * mode, or for a block of frames that have now been copied into the local
 * Audio object.  Variable feedback if it were necessary was applied during
 * the copy, we don't need it here.
 *
 * Segment Fades:
 *
 * If we're flattening, then trimming the segments will increment their
 * copy counts which will then disable fades.
 *
 * If we're not flattening, trimming will enable fades which is usually
 * what we want.  In theory, we could go back in later and move the
 * startFrame back, or add a segment that referenced the adjacent content,
 * this will be handled in compileSegmentFades.
 *
 * NOTE: If we're flattening and feedback is lowered, there can still
 * be significant level differences if we retrigger and leave segments
 * behind before the copy is complete.  This is partially addressed in
 * finalize() which will set the ending feedback level on any remaining
 * segments, but if we wanted to support jumping around at random, it
 * would be more complicated.

 * First implementation:
 * 
 * Synthesize three new segments, one containing the contents of this
 * layer up to the insert point, one containing a new insert layer, and
 * another containing the contents of this layer after the insert point.  
 * Insert fades can be performed transiently by Segment.  
 * 
 * If all we had to deal with was a single backing segment, this would
 * be easy.  But in theory there could be more than one segment, 
 * and we may also have local Audio.  The easiest thing is to create a new
 * dummy Layer holding our current segments/audio.  Then reference this
 * layer in our side segments.  Then create a new Audio for any remaining
 * overdubs in this layer.  
 *
 * This works ok, but results in a lot of segment hierarchy if there
 * are a bunch of little SUS inserts in the same layer.
 *
 * Second implementation:
 * 
 * The local Audio is by definition either empty, or we're inserting
 * after any previous recording, we can't be inserting in front of
 * previously recorded frames because we would have shifted the loop.
 * So, all we need to do for local audio is make it bigger and append
 * like a normal recording.  We do however have to detect when we've
 * inserted one cycles worth of material, and grow the layer by another cycle.
 *
 * When the first cycle is inserted, we have to find any segments that
 * span the startFrame and split them (normally there will be only one).
 * Segments that begin on or after the startFrame have their offsets
 * increased by one cycle.  As we insert new cycles, any segments
 * after the startFrame again have their offsets increased.
 *
 * This results in no additional segment hierarchy and a cleaner 
 * implementation.  This is also exactly what we need for Stutter.
