 * Originally we had several implementations on Windows, SoundTouch,

 * real-time use.
 *
 * During the OS X port PseudoPlugin was used until SoundTouch was
 * ported.  It should no longer be used but may come in handy.
 *
 *
 * We started with PseudoPlugin during initial porting, then added
 * SoundTouchPlugin.

 * Sets new tempo control value. Normal tempo = 1.0, smaller values
 * represent slower tempo, larger faster tempo.
 *
 * void setRateChange(float newRate);
 * Sets new rate control value as a difference in percents compared
 * to the original rate (-50 .. +100 %).
 *
 * void setTempoChange(float newTempo);
 * Sets new tempo control value as a difference in percents compared
 * to the original tempo (-50 .. +100 %)
 *
 * void setPitch(float newPitch);
 * Sets new pitch control value. Original pitch = 1.0, smaller values

 * (-1.00 .. +1.00)
 *
 * void setPitchSemiTones(int newPitch);

 * Sets pitch change in semi-tones compared to the original pitch
 * (-12 .. +12)
 *
 * SETTING_USE_AA_FILTER
 * Enable/disable anti-alias filter in pitch transposer (0 = disable)
 *
 * SETTING_AA_FILTER_LENGTH
 * Pitch transposer anti-alias filter length (8 .. 128 taps, default = 32)
 *
 * SETTING_USE_QUICKSEEK
 * Enable/disable quick seeking algorithm in tempo changer routine
 * (enabling quick seeking lowers CPU utilization but causes a minor sound
 * quality compromising)
 *
 * SETTING_SEQUENCE_MS
 * Time-stretch algorithm single processing sequence length in milliseconds. 
 * This determines to how long sequences the original sound is chopped in the
 * time-stretch algorithm.
 *
 * SETTING_SEEKWINDOW_MS
 * Time-stretch algorithm seeking window length in milliseconds for algorithm
 * that finds the best possible overlapping location. This determines from
 * how wide window the algorithm may look for an optimal joining location when
 * mixing the sound sequences back together. 
 *
 * SETTING_OVERLAP_MS
 * Time-stretch algorithm overlap length in milliseconds. When the chopped
 * sound sequences are mixed back together, to form a continuous sound
 * stream, this parameter defines over how long period the two consecutive
 * sequences are let to overlap each other.
