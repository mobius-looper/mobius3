 *
 * There is no Loop because I think it's always the same
 * as "wait event loop" ?
 *
 * "wait location start" would be the same as "wait frame 0"
 * and "wait location end" would be the same as "wait frame loopFrames"
 *
 * guess it depends on exactly which side of the loop point it is on.
 * Need to verify this.  If we say "end" means "final frame of the loop
 * that is the same as the old "loop".
 *
 * The math was probably wrong here "end" would actually be loopFrames - 1
 * since there is no loopFrames frame, it wraps back to zero.
 *
 * old "Wait subcycle 3" meant "wait frame subcycleFrames * 3" which is the same
 * except if there are fewer than 3 subcycles in the loop.  Yes, that's right
 * it should wrap.  Could consider that an error or a noop.
 *
 * The problem with putting msec and frame back is that it makes it ambiguous
 * with duration msec and frame which are far more common.
