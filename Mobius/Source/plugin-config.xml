  This is an example of what a PluginConfig elemement looks like when inside
  the DeviceConfig.  It is not part of the distribution, use it as a template
  for experimenting with bus layouts in the stock DeviceConfig that just uses
  the defeault aux port counts.

      <Input name="InPort3" channels="2"/>
      <Output name="OutPort2" channels="2"/>
      <Output name="OutPort3" channels="2"/>
