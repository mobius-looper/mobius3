rclone is a command line tool for doing bulk transfers of web site files.
It supports a large number of network protocols, but I only use simple FTP.

Executive summary:

To copy a compiled Hugo site enter this command:

rclone copy circularlabs/public zonemobius:public_html/circularlabs.com

!!! DO NOT USE SYNC !!!

The "sync" option will make the destination site match the source site, which
will delete everything on the destination that isn't in the source.  Since I keep
a number of extra files on the server, including the forum, that would get wiped
out using sync.  Always use "rclone copy".

To copy an installer enter this command:

  rclone copy ../install/Output/MobiusSetup.exe zonemobius:public_html/circularlabs.com




Get it here:
https://rclone.org/install/

It is a single .exe file, copy it to c:/cygwin64/usr/local/bin

You must first configure a "remote" which is where all the FTP connection
parameters are defined.  These are stored in a file, I noticed this:

rclone listremotes
2024/05/19 17:01:28 NOTICE: Config file "C:\\Users\\jeff\\AppData\\Roaming\\rclone\\rclone.conf" not found - using defaults

To configure a remote do:

  rclone config
  
Run this in a non-emacs terminal window, it will ask a lot of questions.
I didn't try it, but you can probably just edit the rclone.conf file manually
for simple things and save time.

Once the remote is configured you reference it by name followed by a colon,
followed by a path relative to the root of the FTP server.  

rclone copy circularlabs/public zonemobius:public_html/circularlabs.com

Docs are really confusing on the syntax of the arguments.  When you see "remote:"
It means replace "remote" with the name of your remote configuration, in my case "zonemobius".

So this:

rclone copy hello.txt zonemobius:

copies the hello.txt file to the root of the FTP server which is /home/zonemobi in cpanel.

The installation package is a .zip file containing these files:

  -rw-rw-rw-  1 jeff jeff   125681 05-18 21:17 git-log.txt
  -rw-rw-rw-  1 jeff jeff  2513938 05-18 21:17 rclone.1
  -rwxrwxrwx  1 jeff jeff 60416000 05-18 21:17 rclone.exe
  -rw-rw-rw-  1 jeff jeff  2684491 05-18 21:17 README.html
  -rw-rw-rw-  1 jeff jeff  2317711 05-18 21:17 README.txt

The .txt file has a lot of information, but I mostly just read the web site.

Initial Setup Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tried initially with SFTP but it hung.  FTP works.

Loki setup I just hacked at till it worked.  Thor has detailed notes below.

Docs are really confusing on the syntax of the arguments.  When you see "remote:"
It means replace "remote" with the name of your remote configuration, in my case "zonemobius".

So this:

rclone copy hello.txt zonemobius:

copies the hello.txt file to the root of the FTP server which is /home/zonemobi in cpanel.

Basic usage:

rclone copy mobius/public zonemobius:public_html/hairycrazyants.com

This seems to require that it be at the root of the domain directory under
public_html, probably because of the baseUrl thing in hugo.toml which is
"/" but can't be changed without messing up the local hugo server.

rclone listremotes
2024/05/19 17:01:28 NOTICE: Config file "C:\\Users\\jeff\\AppData\\Roaming\\rclone\\rclone.conf" not found - using defaults

It likes to ask questions so can't do this from an emacs shell, use cygwin

https://rclone.org/docs/

Enter this:

  rclone config

Enters this dialog...

No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New Remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit

Type: n

Enter name for new remote>
name> zonemobius

Type of storage to configre.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value.
...
15 FTP
...
Storage> 15

Option host.
FTP host to connect to.
e.g. "ftp.example.com".
Enter a value.

host> ftp.zonemobius.com

Option user.
FTP Username.
Enter a string value.  Press Enter for the default (THOR\jeff)

user> zonemobi

Option port.
FTP port number.
Enter a signed integer. Prese Enter for the default (21)

port> (enter)

Option pass.
FTP password.
Choose an alternative below.  Press enter for the default (n).
y) Yes, type in my own password
g) Generate random password
n) No, leave this optional password blank

y/g/n> y

Enter the password:
password: hanson@9799
confirm...

Option tls.
Use Implicit FTPS (FTP over TLS).
When using implicit FTP over TLS the client connects using TLS
right from the start which breaks compatibility with non-TLS-aware servers.
This is usually served over port 990 rather than port 21.  Cannot be used in
combination with explicit FTPS.
Enter a boolean value (true or false).  Press Enter for the default (false).

tls> (enter)

Option explicit_tls.
Use Explicit FTPS (FTP over TLS).
When using explicit FTP over TLS the client explicitly requests
security from the server in order to upgrade a plain text connection
to an encrypted one. Cannot be used in combination with implicit FTPS.
Enter a boolean value (true or false). Press Enter for the default (false).

explicit_tls> (enter)

Edit advanced config?
y) Yes
n) No (default)

y/n> (enter)

Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: ftp
- host: ftp.zonemobius.com
- user: zonemobi
- pass: *** ENCRYPTED ***
Keep this "zonemobius" remote?
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote

Now we're in a top level menu where you can edit existing, create new etc.
c:/Users/Jeff/AppData/Roaming/rclone/rclone.conf has this:

[zonemobius]
type = ftp
host = ftp.zonemobius.com
user = zonemobi
pass = rwjbHNWgnI94_ZclR6dTuBL7ENhdd4m-juln


So everything I could just type in except for the password
