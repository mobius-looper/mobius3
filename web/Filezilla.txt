Filezilla is the FTP client I use to upload files to the Midphase server.
Any FTP client would do the job but this one is free and works well enough.

The Midphase FTP configuration is:

  FTP host: ftp.zonemobius.com

I did not specify a port or override the default TLS setting.
The default port seems to be 21.

To upload individual files, click the destination folder on the right, then
navigate to the source file on the left, right click, and select Upload.
