Mobius 3 is available as an early release for 64-bit Windows and Mac computers.
It runs as both a standalone application and as a VST3 and AudioUnit plugin.
While most of the functionality of the original Mobius has been preserved, it has been extensively
redesigned and many new features have been added.  If you are new to Mobius, the documentation is incomplete and this may not be the best time to learn.  Please join the forum for support.  

The forum can be accessed from the [Community](forum/public) item in the main menu.  There is also an active [Mobius Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/mobiuscentral) on Facebook.
