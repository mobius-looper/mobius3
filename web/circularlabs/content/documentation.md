## New Documentation

A full set of documentation for Mobius 3 is in progress but not ready.   Much of the documentation
from  Mobius 2.5 is still relevant and can be referred to for some things, but all of the user interface screen captures are no longer the same.  

New documentation will be focused on new features and things that have changed since 2.5.
These will be released in parts over time as [Feature Notes](../notes)

If you are a new user and have questions about getting started, the best place to learn
is the [Forum](../forum/public).

## Old Documentation

The installation process is different than it was in 2.5.  The configuration of MIDI and
audio devices is different but relatively self explanatory.
