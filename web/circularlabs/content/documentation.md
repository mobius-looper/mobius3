A full set of documentation for Mobius 3 is in progress but not complete.   Much of the documentation
from  Mobius 2.5 is still relevant and can be referred to for some things, but all of the user interface screen captures are no longer the same.  

New documentation will be focused on new features and things that have changed since 2.5.  If you are a new user and have questions about getting started, the best place to learn is the [Forum](../forum/public).

## New Documentation

- [Sessions](../docs/sessions)
- [Transport](../docs/transport)
- [Using MIDI Tracks](../docs/using-midi)
- [Upgrading from 2.5](../docs/upgrading)

## Feature Notes

Informal discussions about new features can be found in [Feature Notes](../notes).  The articles here are intended to spark discussion about future plans and things still under development.  If you find a topic interesting, or would like to suggest a new topic, please post about it on the [Forum](../forum/public).

## Old Documentation

The installation process is different than it was in 2.5.  The configuration of MIDI and
audio devices is different but relatively self explanatory.  OSC is not yet supported in Mobius 3.
