Spectral is a complex but very pretty Hugo theme.  It works well enough
but it does things I don't want and is really confusing to change so
look for something simpler.

All of the configuration I needed was nicely in the hugo.toml file,
so far I haven't made any changes to the original code, though I would
like to make the header area around the page titles smaller.

Installation Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The git repo is:

  https://github.com/sbruder/spectral

You normally check this out as a git submodule.

Originally I just cloned the repository directly under circularlabs/themes
When I added the surrounding site to my git repo it said this:

warning: adding embedded git repository: UI/Source/web/first/themes/spectral
hint: You've added another git repository inside your current repository.
hint: Clones of the outer repository will not contain the contents of
hint: the embedded repository and will not know how to obtain it.
hint: If you meant to add a submodule, use:
hint: 
hint: 	git submodule add <url> UI/Source/web/first/themes/spectral
hint: 
hint: If you added this path by mistake, you can remove it from the
hint: index with:
hint: 
hint: 	git rm --cached UI/Source/web/first/themes/spectral
hint: 
hint: See "git help submodule" for more information.

Checking out the submodule left this in c:/dev/jucetest/.submodules

[submodule "UI/Source/web/mobius/themes/spectral"]
	path = UI/Source/web/mobius/themes/spectral
	url = https://github.com/sbruder/spectral

Need to learn more about git submodules.

I did that, but since it isn't in my git repo it doesn't sync across
machines.  For simplicity, I removed the .submodules file and related
.git files under themes/spectral and just checked everything in to
my repo.
