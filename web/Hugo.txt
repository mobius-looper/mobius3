Hugo is a static web site generator.  Download it here:

https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.125.7

The .zip has a single hugo.exe file, after decompression copy this to
a location on the shell search path.  I only do web site management
from Windows with Cygwin so it was copied to c:/cygwin64/usr/local/bin.

The source for the circularlabs.com site is under the circularlabs directory.

Note that it is crucial that you add this to hugo.toml in order to use embedded HTML in Markup files

[markup.goldmark.renderer]
unsafe= true

To build the site, go there and enter this command:

   hugo --buildDrafts

The --buildDrafts argument is necessary because I'm still using the default
template which makes every Markdown file a draft by default.  Need to fix that.

To test the site locally enter this command:

  hugo server -D

I think the -D means to include draft files.

The compiled site is found under the "public" directory under the root directory.
To publish the site, head over to Rclone.txt

If you need to make surgical changes to individual files without copying the entire site,
just use Filezilla and upload them one at a time.

The download pages expect the two installation binaries to be in the root folder
for the web site.  Currently they are:

   www.circularlabs.com/MobiusSetup.exe
   www.circularlabs.com/Mobius.pkg

Those two need to be uploaded individually with Filzilla after building
the installers, they are not part of the Hugo site.

From the root of the Midphase hosting site the paths to circularlabs.com
is:

   /public_html/circularlabs.com

Content Pages
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Pages are written in Markdown and are found under the circiularlabs/content
directory.  After compilation the names of each file become the names
of directories under public: about, community, downloads, etc.  I'm assuming
this means you can't have a content page whose name conflicts with one of
the Hugo system directories like categories, fonts, css, etc. since they
are at the same level.

Using the Spectral theme, links to the pages are written in the hugo.toml file
and then referenced deep within the Spectral code.  I don't know how common
this is, but it's convenient since Spectral is hella complex.

List Pages
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Had to hack around with Spectral to get the list pages

In spectral/layouts/_default/list.html

  <header {{ with .Params.image }}style="background-image: url('{{ . }}')"{{ end }}>
    <!--
        <h2>{{ i18n "allarticles" }}</h2>
        -->
    <h2>{{ .Params.title }}</h2>

Substitute an i18n lookup of "allarticles" to a parameter named "title"

The title is then set by putting an _index.md in the directory containing the
list files:

+++
#aliases = ["posts", "articles", "blog", "showcase", "docs"]
title = "Feature Notes"
author = "Jeff"
tags = ["index"]
+++


The default Spectral list page also had dates.  To remove those comment out this line:

+++ b/web/circularlabs/themes/spectral/layouts/partials/summary.html
@@ -1,7 +1,7 @@
 <section class="wrapper style5">
 	<div class="inner">
     <h2><a href="{{ .Permalink }}">{{ .Title }}</a></h2>
-    <time class="icon fa-clock-o">{{ .Date.Format "02.01.2006 15:04" }}</time>
+<!--    <time class="icon fa-clock-o">{{ .Date.Format "02.01.2006 15:04" }}</time> -->

Download Problem
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There is something wonky with the download links in the downloads.md page.
They render fine, and the link hover text is correct, but Chrome refuses
to actually download the file.  There is a brief fliker and the page appears
to refresh but nothing downloads.  I thought it might be security settings
in Chrome but I turned off the things I could find and that didn't work.

Both Safari and Opera download the file as expected.  Weirdly, if you right
click on the link and chose "Save link as" it will download.

Also weirdly, when the site is running locally under the Hugo server, the
link works normally in Chrome.  So it is possibly related to the Midphase
server as well as Chrome.

I could have sworn that the original large Download button on the Spectral
home page worked, but I didn't dig into the Spectral source to see how
that was rendered.

Oh, it's because the URL on the page wasn't using https://

Chrome started preventing downloads of http:// downloads

Changed to https:// and it started working again
