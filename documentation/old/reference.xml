<section><title>Introduction</title>

<p>In this manual we will provide complete but concise documentation
for every mode, function, control, and parameter that exists in
Mobius.  This is intended for advanced users that are already somewhat
familiar with what these items do, but may need clarification on how
they behave and interact.  If you are interested in tutorials that
describe in detail how and why you might use these items, read
the <a href='techniques.htm'>Mobius Techniques</a> manual first.  When
an item in the reference manual has also been documented in any of the
other manuals we will provide links to the other manuals.  You can use
the reference manual like an index to get a brief overview of a topic
of interest, then follow links to more detailed documentation
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Note that some of the items in the reference manual are
accessible only in scripts so you will not see them in the binding
windows or other parts of the user interface.  We will provide brief
script examples here, but for details on writing scripts read
the <a href='scripts.htm'>Mobius Scripting</a> manual.</p>

<p>The reference manual is not intended to be read from top to bottom.
Most of the sections are arranged alphabetically to make it easier to
locate something of interest.  It is however recommended that you read
the <ref>Concepts</ref> section first because these will clarify some
of the terms used in this manual.</p>

<section><title>Concepts</title>

<p>Mobius has a lot of "things" in it that can be controlled by
external triggers or used in scripts.  In this introductory section we
will review the major categories of things and define
several important concepts that will be used throughout the reference
manual.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you read this section completely before
reading anything else in the reference manual.</p>


<section><title>Display Names and Internal Names</title>

<p>The various things you can see and use in Mobius will usually have
both a "display name" and an "internal name".  The display name is
what you will see in the user interface and will be the title of the
section in the reference manual that documents the thing. 
The internal name is the name you must use to refer to
that thing in a script.  Usually they are similar.  If the display
name contains spaces the spaces will be removed in the internal name.
Display names always start with a capital letter, internal names for
parameters always start with a lower case letter.  A few internal
names will use abbreviations or fewer words than the display name.</p>

<p>You don't need to care about internal names until you decide
to write scripts.</p>

<p>For example, "Speed Up" is the display name for the
function with the internal name "SpeedUp" and  
"Switch Quantize" is the display name for the parameter
with the internal name "switchQuantize".</p>

</section> <!-- Display/Internal Names -->

<section><title id='conceptParameter'>Parameters</title>

<p>A <i>parameter</i> is named value that influences how Mobius
behaves. There are four categories of parameters: <b>global
parameters</b>, <b>setup parameters</b>, <b>track parameters</b> and
<b>preset parameters</b>.</p>

<p>Global parameters control general operating characteristics such as
whether input monitoring is enabled, or how many tracks should
be displayed.  They are set in the <i>Global Parameters</i> popup 
window.</p>

<p>Setup parameters define things that effect all tracks at the same time,
most of these are related to track synchronization.  They are set
under the <i>Synchronization</i> and <i>Other</i> tabs of the 
<i>Track Setups</i> popup window.</p>

<p>Track parameters control a few characteristics of each track such
as the track name, group number, and input focus.  These are relatively
unusual and are used mostly in scripts.  They are set under the
<i>Tracks</i> tab of the <i>Track Setups</i> popup window.</p>

<p>Preset parameters control how functions behave, examples
include <ref>Record Threshold</ref>, <ref>Quantize Mode</ref>, and 
<ref>Empty Loop Action</ref>.  Most of the time when we talk about
parameters we are talking about preset parameters.  They are set in
the <i>Presets</i> popup window.</p>

<p>Parameters have a <i>type</i> which determines how they are shown
in the user interface and how they can be used in scripts.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Integer</b> - a small positive number</li>
<li><b>String</b> - a line of text</li>
<li><b>Boolean</b> - a true or false value, displayed as a checkbox</li>
<li><b>Enumeration</b> - one of a fixed set of values, displayed as a menu</li>
</ul>

<p>Some parameters can be bound to triggers such as MIDI events but this is
relatively unusual.  More often parameters are set in scripts that are
bound to MIDI triggers.  If you do bind a MIDI trigger to a parameter,
you should use a MIDI continuous controller.  This is because unlike
functions parameters have a <i>ranged value</i> and you need a trigger
that can sweep over all the values in the range.</p>

<p>You cannot bind parameters of type <i>String</i>, those can only be
changed from scripts.  You can bind to parameters of
type <i>Integer</i> though this is rarely useful.  The integer range
of a MIDI continuous controller is from 0 to 127, but it can be
difficult to dial in an exact number.  If you bind a non-ranged
trigger such as a MIDI note to an integer parameter it will simply
increment the current value by one each time it is triggered, wrapping
back to zero when the maximum value is reached.  Binding to parameters
of type <i>Enumeration</i> is more useful, the 128 step range of a
MIDI continuous controller is divided into regions for each value in
the enumeration.  For example the <ref>Shuffle Mode</ref> parameter has four
possible values, so CC messages from 0 to 31 select the first value, 
CC messages from 32 to 63 select the second value and so on.  If you
bind a non-ranged trigger to an enumeration parameter it will cycle
through the possible values.  Binding to a parameter of type
<i>Boolean</i> is similar to binding to an enumeration parameter.  There
are only two possible values, true and false, so a MIDI continuous
controller will be divided into two regions and non-ranged triggers
will simply toggle the value.</p>

</section> <!-- Parameters -->

<section><title id='conceptControl'>Controls</title>

<p>A <i>control</i> is a named value that controls how audio is
recorded and played in a track.  Controls are similar to
track <ref id='conceptParameter'>Parameters</ref> but their values
 are always integers and
they have a larger range than most parameters.  They are usually set
by a MIDI device that sends <i>continuous controller</i> messages such
as a rotating knob or a foot pedal.</p>

<p>There are five built-in controls:</p>

<ul>
<li><ref>Input Level</ref></li>
<li><ref>Output Level</ref></li>
<li><ref>Feedback</ref></li>
<li><ref>Secondary Feedback</ref></li>
<li><ref>Pan</ref></li>
</ul>

<p>The initial values for all track controls is set in the
<a href='exploring.htm#trackSetup'>track setup</a>.  Controls may then 
be changed by binding them to triggers, or by turning knobs
in the user interface.</p>


</section> <!-- Controls -->

<section><title id='conceptVariable'>Variables</title>

<p>A variable is similar to a <i>parameter</i>, it is a named value
that holds information about the current Mobius state.  Unlike parameters
though, most variables cannot be changed.  They can only be read
in scripts and used to make decisions.  Variables change as a side
effect of normal Mobius operation.  For example the variable
<a href='scripts.htm#loopFrame'>loopFrame</a>
has the current record position in the current loop of the active track.</p>

<p>There are many variables, some are frequently used in scripts,
others are esoteric and intended only for unit testing.  Since variables
can only be used in scripts they are documented
in the <a href='scripts.htm#Variables'>Mobius Scripting</a>
manual.</p>

</section> <!-- Variables -->

<section><title id='conceptMode'>Modes</title>

<p>A <i>mode</i> is a temporary state that a loop can be in.  Modes
have a name that will normally displayed in the center of the Mobius
window.  Modes are usually caused by the execution of
a <ref id='conceptFunction'>function</ref> but there are also a few
system modes that are not associated with any particular function.
There are two types of modes, <i>major modes</i> and <i>minor
modes</i>.</p>

<p>A loop can only be in one <i>major mode</i> at a time.  Examples of
major modes are <ref id='modeReset'>Reset</ref>,
<ref id='modeRecord'>Record</ref>, <ref id='modePlay'>Play</ref>
and <ref id='modeMultiply'>Multiply</ref>.  When a function
needs to change the major mode, the current mode must be ended before
the new one begins.  <ref id='conceptModeEnding'>Ending a major mode</ref>
can be a complex process that
requires extra time, this may delay the change to the new mode.
While a major mode is active, some functions may change their behavior.</p>

<p>A loop can be in any number of <i>minor modes</i> at the same time.
Examples of minor modes include <ref id='modeReverse'>Reverse</ref>,
<ref id='modeSpeedToggle'>Speed Toggle</ref>, and
<ref id='modePitchStep'>Pitch Sttep</ref>.  With a few exceptions minor modes
do not alter the normal behavior of functions.</p>

<p>All major and minor modes are canceled when the loop is
<ref>Reset</ref></p>

<p>To understand what executing a function will do, you must
therefore understand not only what
<ref id='conceptParameter'>Parameters</ref> will influence
the function but also how the current modes will influence the function.
In the user interface, the current major mode is displayed with the
<a href='starting.htm#Mode'>Mode Component</a>
and the active minor modes are displayed with the
<a href='starting.htm#minorModesComponent'>Minor Mode Component</a>.  It
is recommended that you do not disable these components.</p>

</section> <!-- Modes -->

<section><title id='conceptFunction'>Functions</title>

<p>A <i>function</i> is a named action performed by Mobius at the
request of the user.  Examples include <ref>Record</ref>, <ref>Overdub</ref>,
and <ref>Reset</ref>.   Causing a function to be performed is
called <i>executing</i> the function.</p>

<p>Functions are normally bound to a trigger that is a button of some
kind such as a MIDI footswitch or a computer keyboard key.  Functions do
not have a numeric value so they are not normally bound to MIDI continuous
control pedals, knobs, or faders.  Some functions require that they be bound
to a  <a href='starting.htm#Sustainable Trigger'>Sustainable Trigger</a> that
notifies Mobius both when the trigger is "pressed" and 
when it is "released".  Typically this will be a MIDI <i>Note</i> message.</p>

<p>Functions operate in one of three ways: instant, sustain, and modal.
Instant functions happen immediately.  Sustain functions start when
you press the trigger and end when you release the trigger.  Modal
functions start when you press the trigger the first time, and end
when you press the trigger a second time.</p>

</section> <!-- Functions -->

<section><title id='conceptQuantization'>Function Quantization</title>

<p><i>Quantization</i> causes the execution of functions to happen at
a precise time.  When quantization is disabled functions are usually
executed immediately.  When quantization is enabled, the execution of
the function will be delayed until the next <i>quantization
boundary</i>.  The three quantization boundaries are <i>Loop</i>, 
<i>Cycle</i>, and <i>Subcycle</i>.  Quantization is frequently used
to build loops that have a regular rhythmic quality.</p>

<p>You will see several phrases used in the documentation to describe
the effects of quantization, such as "when quantizing", "during
quantization", or "quantized function".  All of these refer to the
same concept.</p>

<p>For most functions quantization is controlled by the
<ref>Quantize Mode</ref> parameter.  For <i>loop switch</i> functions
this is controlled by the <ref>Switch Quantize</ref> parameter.  A few
functions have their own dedicated quantization parameter.</p>

<p>The important thing to understand about quantization is that while
we may say that a function happens "instantly" or that it "starts when
you press a button", the actual execution of the function may happen
sometime after you press a button if quantization is enabled.  We will
not usually say things like "function X starts when you press a
button, or if quantization is enabled will be deferred until the next
quantization point" as this gets tiresome to read (and write!) over
and over.  Instead you should assume that if a function obeys
quantization that execution may be delayed even though we don't
explicitly say it.</p>

<p>See <a href='starting.htm#Quantize Mode'>Quantize Mode</a> in the
<i>Getting Started With Mobius</i> manual for more information.</p>

</section> <!-- Function Quantization -->

<section><title id='conceptInstantFunction'>Instant Functions</title>

<p>An <i>instant function</i> is one that does something to a loop or
track and then stops.  Note that when we say "instant" this does not
necessarily means it will be executed immediately after it is
triggered, the execution may be delayed if <i>quantization</i> is
enabled.  But when the function is eventually executed, what it does
to the loop happens instantly.  Some examples of this function type
are <ref>Instant Multiply</ref> and <ref>Divide</ref>.</p>

<p>This is in contrast to <ref id='conceptModalFunction'>Modal Functions</ref>
where the function will have a start time and an end time and will have
an effect on the loop over that span of time.</p>

<p>Since instant functions don't have a beginning or end, they
will never be <ref id='conceptSustainFunction'>Sustain Functions</ref>.</p>

</section> <!-- Instant Functions -->

<section><title id='conceptModalFunction'>Modal Functions</title>

<p>When some functions are executed they will continue to have an
effect on the loop for a period of time.  These are called
<i>modal functions</i>.  While the function is active 
the loop is said to be in the <ref id='conceptMode'>mode</ref>
of that function.  The name of the mode is usually but not always the
same as the name of the function.</p>

<p>Both the beginning and ending of a modal function may be subject
to <ref id='conceptQuantization'>quantization</ref>.  A few
functions will also do <ref id='conceptRounding'>rounding</ref>
which is similar to quantization but is not controlled by the
<ref>Quantize Mode</ref> parameter.</p>

<p>Recall from the <ref id='conceptMode'>Modes</ref> section that a
loop may be in only one major mode at a time but it may be in any
number of minor modes at a time.  Functions that change the major mode
are <i>major modal</i> functions and functions that add or remove
minor modes are <i>minor modal</i> functions.  Examples of major modal
functions are <ref>Record</ref>, <ref>Multiply</ref>,
and <ref>Replace</ref>.  Examples of minor modal functions
are <ref>Reverse</ref>, <ref id='functionSpeedToggle'>Speed Toggle</ref>
and <ref>Pitch Up</ref>.</p>

<p>The simplest way to start and end a major mode is to
execute the function twice, the first execution starts the mode and
the second ends it.  But since there can be only one major
mode active at a time, any major modal function will usually end
the previous major modal function.   Some minor modal functions
will also end the current major mode, but others will let the current
mode continue.</p>

<p>Minor modes are less consistent in how they start and end.  Some
belong to a <ref id='conceptFunctionFamily'>function family</ref> that
contain functions to toggle the mode, to force it on, to force it off,
or to change characteristics of the mode rather than turn it off
completely.</p>

<p>See <ref id='conceptModeEnding'>Mode Endings</ref> 
for more details on ending modes.</p>

</section> <!-- Modal Functions -->

<section><title id='conceptRounding'>Rounding Functions</title>

<p>The <ref>Multiply</ref>, <ref>Stutter</ref> and <ref>Insert</ref>
functions all normally do <i>rounding</i> when their modes are ended.
Rounding is similar to quantization, it defers the ending of a mode until a 
special time is reached.  Unlike quantization, rounding is not
influenced by the <ref>Quantize Mode</ref> parameter.</p>

<p>Rounding is done in order to preserve the current loop's cycle
length.  When you use functions that change the loop length, you
usually want the new loop to be an exact multiple of the old loop's
cycle length so that the new loop will play with the same tempo.  When
you end a rounding mode, an event will be scheduled to end the mode
far enough in the future so that the cycle length will be preserved.</p>

<p>Rounding functions can also be ended immediately 
instead of waiting to preserve the cycle length.  When this happens
the cycle length of the loop will be recalculated and the new loop
will contain only one cycle.  If this loop is the <i>MIDI Sync Master</i>
this may change the tempo of the generated MIDI clocks.</p>

</section> <!-- Rounding Functions -->

<section><title id='conceptSustainFunction'>Sustain Functions</title>

<p>A <i>Sustain Function</i> is always a <i>modal function</i> that
begins when you press a <i>sustainable trigger</i> and ends when you
release the trigger.  The most common sustainable trigger is a
MIDI <i>Note</i> message, though MIDI <i>Continuous Control</i>
messages and computer keyboard keys may also be used.</p>

<p>The function generally behaves the same as the non-sustain function
with the same name, the main difference is how the ending is
triggered.  Sustain functions are usually ended when the trigger is released.
If you execute another major modal function while a sustainable
trigger is held down, the sustained mode is ended and the up transition
of the sustainable trigger will be ignored.</p>

<p>Note that the ending of a sustain function is still subject to
quantization.  So if you quickly tap a sustain function trigger when
quantization is enabled, the start of the mode will be delayed until
the next quantization point and the end of the mode will be delayed
until the quantization point after the point where the mode starts.
For example if you are in a loop with the
<ref>Subcycles</ref> parameter set to 4 and are currently in the 
middle of subcycle 1 then quickly tap the button for 
<ref id='functionSpeedToggle'>Speed Toggle</ref>
you will enter <i>SpeedToggle -12</i> mode at the beginning of subcycle 2 and 
end the mode at the beginning of subcycle 3.</p>

</section> <!-- Sustain Functions -->

<section><title id='conceptFunctionFamily'>Function Families</title>

<p>Some related functions may be grouped into <i>families</i>.  These
are usually <i>minor modal</i> functions where each function in the
family can change characteristics of mode rather than simply ending it.
One example is the <i>Speed</i> function family which includes
the functions <ref>Speed Up</ref>, <ref>Speed Down</ref>,
<ref>Speed Cancel</ref>, <ref id='functionSpeedToggle'>Speed Toggle</ref> 
and many others.</p>

</section> <!-- Function Families -->

<section><title id='conceptModeEnding'>Mode Endings</title>

<p>The simplest way to end a major modal function is to execute the
same function again.  But since there can be only one major mode
active at a time, any major modal function will usually end
the previous major modal function.  For example if you are in 
<ref id='modeRecord'>Record</ref> mode you aren't required to 
trigger the <ref>Record</ref> function again to end it, you could
trigger <ref>Overdub</ref> instead which will automatically end
the <ref id='modeRecord'>Record</ref> mode and start 
<ref id='modeOverdubMajor'>Overdub</ref> mode.</p>

<p>If the current mode does <ref id='conceptRounding'>rounding</ref>,
the ending function will normally be delayed until the rounding period
ends.  If you execute more functions during the rounding period they
will be "stacked" and all execute at the end of the rounding period.</p>

<p>Some functions may change their behavior during certain modes.  
Rather than simply executing after the current mode ends, they 
may change the way the mode is ended or even leave the current mode
active.  This is called <b>modal behavior</b> and is similar
to what the EDP calls an "alternate ending".</p>

<p>The most common example of a modal behavior is the <ref>Record</ref>
function when it is used during a <ref id='conceptRounding'>rounding</ref>
mode such as <i>Multiply</i> or <i>Insert</i>.  When <i>Record</i>
is executed in these modes, it will cancel the rounding period and
end the mode immediately.  The new loop will then return to <i>Play</i>
or <i>Overdub</i> mode.  When a function has modal behavior, it will
be included in the documentation for that function, for the mode
in which it is used, and for the function that started the mode.</p>

<p>Minor modal functions are not ended by other functions and they do
not change the behavior of other functions.  To end a minor mode you
usually trigger the same function again or in some cases you trigger a
function from the same <ref id='conceptFunctionFamily'>Function
Family</ref>.  For example the function <ref>Speed Up</ref> will
increase the playback speed by one semitone.  Executing <ref>Speed Up</ref> 
again will not end the speed shift mode, it will increase the
playback speed by another semitone.  To return the speed to normal
you must use either the <ref>Speed Down</ref> function or the
<ref>Speed Cancel</ref> function.</p>

</section> <!-- Mode Endings -->

<section><title>Function Classes</title>

<p>We can divide functions in to several <i>classes</i>.  These classes
are mostly just to help document the functions by showing those
that have similar behavior.  You don't need to know about function
classes except for one special case: the <ref>Mute Cancel</ref>
parameter.</p>

<section><title>Modal Edit Functions</title>

<p>The functions in this class all cause Mobius to enter a <i>major mode</i>
which causes the function to execute over a span of time.  Here you
will find the two most common functions, <i>Record</i>
and <i>Overdub</i>.  All but one modal edit function has both a
sustain and a non-sustain version.  They are called "edit" functions
because they can change the loop in some way.</p>

</ul>

</section> <!-- Modal Edit Functions -->

<section><title id='conceptInstantEdit'>Instant Edit Functions</title>

<p>The functions in this class all cause Mobius to modify the loop
instantly, though some may be delayed due to quantization.  They are
"edit" functions because they all change the loop in some way and
result in the generation of a new layer.</p>

</ul>

</section> <!-- Instant Edit Functions -->

<section><title>Loop Window Functions</title>

<p>The functions in this class cause Mobius to play a section of
the entire loop history.  They are "edit" funtions because they change
the loop in some way and result in the generation of a new layer.  Once
a window layer is generated, the window may be changed without 
generating additional layers.</p>

<ul>
<li><ref>Window Backward</ref></li>

</ul>

</section> <!-- Loop Window Functions -->

<section><title>Reset Functions</title>

<p>The functions in this class cause loops to be reset and all their
content discarded.  In a way they are similar to
<ref id='conceptInstantEdit'>Instant Edit Functions</ref> except they do not create new layers.</p>

<section><title id='classLoopSwitch'>Loop Switch Functions</title>

<p>The functions in this class select the loop within a track to play.
Usually this is a different loop than the one currently playing but
some simply restart the current loop.  This class of function is
very important because most of them have <i>loop switch</i> behavior
which can be quite complex.</p>

<section><title>Mute Functions</title>

<p>The functions in this class all perform some form of mute,
temporarily silencing the loop.  They are similar to 
<ref>Effect Functions</ref> in that they are temporary and non-destructive.
But it is important that they have their own class because it is used to
define the behavior of the <ref>Mute Cancel Functions</ref>
parameter.</p>

-->

<section><title id='modeConfirm'>Confirm</title>

<p><i>Confirm</i> mode is active while you are in the
<i>confirmation period</i> of a loop switch.  This happens when
you have the <ref>Switch Quantize</ref> parameter set to 
<i>Confirm</i>, <i>Confirm Subcycle</i>, <i>Confirm Cycle</i>, 
or <i>Confirm Loop</i>.</p>

<p>While you are in the confirmation period you may "stack" functions
to be executed after the switch.  When you are ready to do the switch
you must use a confirmation function such as <ref>Confirm</ref> or any
other function defined in the <ref>Confirmation Functions</ref>
parameter.  By default, the <ref>Undo</ref> function will also operate
as a switch confirmation function.</p>

<p>The loop is not being modified while in Confirm mode, though
if <ref>Feedback</ref> is reduced the loop is allowed to decay.</p>

<p>See <a href='techniques.htm#switching'>Loop Switching</a> 
in the <i>Mobius Techniques</i> manual for more information on
loop switching and using switch quantization.</p>

</section> <!-- Confirm -->

<section><title id='modeInsert'>Insert</title>

<p><i>Insert</i> mode is active while you are executing
the <ref>Insert</ref>, <ref>Sustain Insert</ref>, or 
<ref>Sustain Unrounded Insert</ref> functions.
During <i>Insert</i> mode new empty space is being added to the loop
and any sound being received by the track is overdubbed into that space.</p>

<p><i>Insert</i> is a <ref id='conceptRounding'>rounding</ref> mode unless
it was started by the <ref>Sustain Unrounded Insert</ref> function.  During
<i>Insert</i> mode, the <ref>Record</ref> function will cancel the rounding
period and end the insert immediately.</p>

</section> <!-- Insert -->

<section><title id='modeMultiply'>Multiply</title>

<p><i>Insert</i> mode is active while you are executing
the <ref>Multiply</ref>, <ref>Sustain Multiply</ref>, or 
<ref>Sustain Unrounded Multiply</ref> functions.
During <i>Multiply</i> mode new space may be added to the loop
by copying the original cycle and appending it to the end.  Sound
being received by the track will be merged with the current content
of the loop in the same way as
<ref id='modeOverdubMajor'>Overdub</ref> mode.</p>

<p><i>Multiply</i> is a <ref id='conceptRounding'>rounding</ref> mode unless
it was started by the <ref>Sustain Unrounded Multiply</ref> function.  During
<i>Multiply</i> mode, the <ref>Record</ref> function will cancel the rounding
period and end the multiply immediately.</p>

</section> <!-- Multiply -->

<section><title id='modeMuteMajor'>Mute</title>

<p><i>Mute</i> mode is unusual because it may be displayed as both a
major and a minor mode.  When the <i>Mute</i> minor mode is active,
and no other major mode is active besides <i>Play</i>, we will
display <i>Mute</i> as the major mode to make it easier to see.  When
the <i>Mute</i> minor mode is active, the loop will continue to
advance but no sound will be sent out of the track.</p>

<p><i>Mute</i> mode is toggled by the <ref>Mute</ref> and 
<ref>Global Mute</ref> functions.   <ref>Sustain Mute</ref> and
<ref>Sustain Mute Restart</ref> will force mute on when the function
trigger is pressed and force it off when the trigger is released. 
<ref>Mute Realign</ref> and <ref>Mute MIDI Start</ref> will force mute on, 
then automatically turn it off when certain synchronization points are 
reached.</p>

<p>When you execute a function that wants to change the major mode,
the loop may still remain muted during the new mode.  Whether the mute
continues or is canceled is determined by the
<ref>Mute Cancel</ref> and <ref>Mute Cancel Functions</ref> parameters.  
If the mute is not canceled then the major mode will change and the
loop may be modified, but it will still continue to be silent.  
You will continue to see <i>Mute</i>
appear as a minor mode.  This technique can be used to modify loops
while the audience can't hear them creating a surprise when the
loop is unmuted.</p>

</section> <!-- Mute -->

<section><title id='modeOverdubMajor'>Overdub</title>

<p><i>Overdub</i> mode is unusual because it may be displayed as both
a major and a minor mode.  When the <i>Overdub</i> minor mode is active
and no other major mode is active besides <i>Play</i>, 
we will display <i>Overdub</i> as the major mode to make it easier to see.</p>

<p>When <i>Overdub</i> is the
major mode any sound being received by the track will be merged with the
current content of the loop.  When <i>Overdub</i> is a minor mode
but is not displayed as the major mode, overdubbing is suspended and will
resume when the current major mode ends.  Leaving overdub suspended
is a useful technique to create "seamless" recordings when changing
from one mode to another.  For example, if overdub is on and the
major mode is <ref>Replace</ref>, when leaving <i>Replace</i> mode we will
immediately enable <i>Overdub</i> mode and can avoid a fade out of
the end of the replaced section.</p>

<p><i>Overdub</i> mode is toggled by the <ref>Overdub</ref> function.
The <ref>Sustain Overdub</ref> function will force overdub on when the
trigger is pressed and off when it is released.</p>

</section> <!-- Overdub -->

<section><title id='modePause'>Pause</title>

<p><i>Pause</i> mode is active while you are executing
the <ref>Pause</ref> or <ref>Global Pause</ref> functions.
During <i>Pause</i> mode the loop freezes and does not advance. No would
will be sent out from the track.</p>

<p>Pause mode is canceled by any major modal function.</p>

<!-- TOOD: Should be able to change speed, pitch, and direction
during pause mode without canceling the pause?  Could
use Mute Cancel Functions for this but that lets you do things
that don't make sense, any editing function like Replace has
to cancel the pause, though I suppose you could queue them and
execute them after unpausing....
-->

</section> <!-- Pause -->

<section><title id='modePlay'>Play</title>

<p><i>Play</i> mode is the default system mode that is active
when the loop is not empty and is not in any other major mode.
During <i>Play</i> mode the loop will advance and the sound in the
loop will be sent to the output device assigned to this track.</p>

</section> <!-- Play -->

<section><title id='modeRecord'>Record</title>

<p><i>Record</i> mode is active while you are executing the
<ref>Record</ref>, <ref>Auto Record</ref>, or <ref>Sustain Record</ref>
functions.
During <i>Record</i> mode, a new initial loop is being created and
no sound will be sent out of the track.</p>

</section> <!-- Record -->

<section><title id='modeRehearse'>Rehearse</title>

<p><i>Rehearse</i> mode is active while you are executing the
<ref>Rehearse</ref> function and
you are in the <i>rehearse</i> phase, listening to what was just recorded.
<ref>Rehearse</ref> is an unusual function because sets two major
modes, <i>Rehearse</i> and <i>Rehearse Record</i>.</p>

<p><i>Rehearse</i> mode is a special form of <ref id='modePlay'>Play</ref>
mode, you will hear the loop that was just recorded but if you
let the loop play to the end you will return to 
<ref id='modeRehearseRecord'>Rehearse Record</ref> mode.</p>

</section> <!-- Rehearse -->

<section><title id='modeRehearseRecord'>Rehearse Record</title>

<p><i>Rehearse Record</i> mode is active while you are executing the
<ref>Rehearse</ref> function and
you are in the <i>record</i> phase, recording a new loop.  
<ref>Rehearse</ref> is an unusual function because sets two major
modes, <i>Rehearse</i> and <i>Rehearse Record</i>.</p>

<p><i>Rehearse Record</i> mode is a special form of 
<ref id='modeRecord'>Record</ref> mode, you are recording a new loop and
no sound will be sent out of the track.  Once you end the recording
you will enter <ref ref='modeRehearse'>Rehearse</ref> mode where
you can review what you just recorded and decide whether to keep
it or make another recording.</p>

</section> <!-- Rehearse Record -->

<section><title id='modeReplace'>Replace</title>

<p><i>Replace</i> mode is active while you are executing the
<ref>Replace</ref> or <ref>Sustain Replace</ref> functions.
During <i>Replace</i> mode the current content of the loop is removed
and replace with the sound being received by the track.</p>

</section> <!-- Replace -->

<section><title id='modeReset'>Reset</title>

<p><i>Reset</i> mode is a default system mode that will be active
whenever the loop is empty.  All loops will be in <i>Reset</i> mode
when Mobius is started for the first time.  Loops may also be placed
in <i>Reset</i> mode after loading a project that does not contain
audio content for every loop.  Once a loop has content, you can make
it empty by executing the
<ref>Reset</ref>, <ref>Track Reset</ref>, or <ref>Global Reset</ref>
functions.</p>

</section> <!-- Reset -->

<section><title id='modeRun'>Run</title>

<p><i>Run</i> mode is an internal system mode that you normally will
never see.  It is involved with latency compensation and usually lasts
such a brief period of time that it won't be seen in the user interface.
The loop is not being changed during <i>Run</i> mode, though it may
be playing.</p>

</section> <!-- Run -->

<section><title id='modeSolo'>Solo</title>

<p><i>Solo</i> mode is activated by the <ref>Solo</ref> function. 
The loop that is in <i>Solo</i> mode will be heard playing, but the
loops in all other tracks will be muted.  The other tracks
will be in <ref id='modeSoloMute'>Solo Mute</ref> mode.</p>

<!-- TODO: This isn't a real mode yet -->

</section> <!-- Solo -->

<section><title id='modeSoloMute'>Solo Mute</title>

<p><i>Solo Mute</i> mode is activated by the <ref>Solo</ref> function. 
The active loop in the active track will enter <ref id='modeSolo'>Solo</ref>
mode and all other tracks will enter <i>Solo Mute</i> mode.  While
a track is in <i>Solo Mute</i> mode, no sound will be sent out from the 
track.</p>

<!-- TODO: This isn't a real mode yet -->

</section> <!-- Solo Mute -->

<section><title id='modeStutter'>Stutter</title>

<p><i>Stutter</i> mode is active when you are executing
the <ref>Stutter</ref> or <ref>Sustain Stutter</ref> functions.
During <i>Stutter</i> mode the loop is being extended by copying the
contents previous cycle and inserting it after the end of that cycle.
After a cycle has been inserted, sound being received by the track
will be merged with content of the new cycle in the same
way as <ref id='modeOverdubMajor'>Overdub</ref> mode.</p>

</section> <!-- Stutter -->

<section><title id='modeSubstitute'>Substitute</title>

<p><i>Substitute</i> mode is active while you are executing the
<ref>Substitute</ref> or <ref>Sustain Substitute</ref> functions.
During <i>Substitute</i> mode the current content of the loop may
be completely or partially removed and merged with the sound being
received by the track.</p>

</section> <!-- Substitute -->

<section><title id='modeSwitch'>Switch</title>

<p><i>Switch</i> mode is active whenever you have used <ref>Next Loop</ref>
or any of the other <ref id='classLoopSwitch'>loop switching</ref> 
functions and the <ref>Switch Quantize</ref> parameter is set to 
something other than <i>Off</i>.  The switch is being delayed until 
a quantization point.  During <i>Switch</i> mode you can "stack" functions 
to be executed after the switch.</p>

</section> <!-- Switch -->

<section><title id='modeSynchronize'>Synchronize</title>

<p><i>Synchronize</i> mode is active when you have executed
a <ref>Record</ref>, <ref>Auto Record</ref>, or <ref>Sustain Record</ref> 
function, and the loop is waiting for a synchronization
pulse to begin recording.  This can happen when <ref>Sync Source</ref>
or <ref>Default Sync Source</ref> is set to something other than 
<i>None</i>.  During <i>Synchronize</i> mode 
the loop is not changing or playing.</p>

</section> <!-- Synchronize -->

<section><title id='modeThreshold'>Threshold</title>

<p><i>Threshold</i> mode is active when you have executed
a <ref>Record</ref>, <ref>Auto Record</ref>, or <ref>Sustain Record</ref> 
function, and the loop is waiting for an audio
signal to be received by the track whose average volume exceeds
a threshold.  This happens when the <ref>Record Threshold</ref> 
parameter is set to a value greater than zero.  During <i>Threshold</i>
mode the loop is not changing or playing.</p>

<section><title id='modeCapture'>Capture</title>

<p><i>Capture</i> mode is active after executing the <ref>Start Capture</ref>
function.  While <i>Capture</i> mode is active, all audio being received
by and sent from the tracks is captured and may be saved to a file.
<i>Capture</i> mode is ended by the <ref>Stop Capture</ref>
or <ref>Save Capture</ref> functions.</p>

<section><title id='modeMaster'>Master</title>

<p><i>Master</i> mode is active after a loop has been recorded and
the track containing it becomes both the <i>MIDI Sync Master</i> and the 
<i>Track Sync Master</i> track.  When a track is the <i>MIDI Sync Master</i>
it will send MIDI clocks to the configured output device at a tempo
calculated from the loop length.  When a track is the <i>Track Sync Master</i>
other tracks will synchronize the start and end of the <ref>Record</ref>
function to quantization points in the master track.</p>

</section> <!-- Master -->

<section><title id='modeMIDIMaster'>MIDI Master</title>

<p><i>MIDI Master</i> mode is active after a loop has been recorded and
the track containing the <i>MIDI Sync Master</i> track. When a track is the
<i>MIDI Sync Master</i> it will send MIDI clocks to the configured output
device at a tempo calculated from the loop length.</p>

</section> <!-- MIDI Master -->

<section><title id='modeMuteMinor'>Mute</title>

<p><i>Mute</i> mode is active after executing
the <ref>Mute</ref>, <ref>Global Mute</ref>, <ref>Mute Realign</ref>, 
<ref>Mute MIDI Start</ref>, <ref>Sustain Mute</ref>, or 
<ref>Sustain Mute Restart</ref> functions.
During <i>Mute</i> mode the loop will continue to advance but no sound will
be sent out of the track.</p>

<p><i>Mute</i> mode is unusual because it is both a major and a minor
mode.  When the <i>Mute</i> minor mode is active and no other
major mode is active besides <i>Play</i>, we will display <i>Mute</i>
as the major mode.</p>

<p>When you execute a function that wants to change the major
mode, the loop may still remain muted during the new mode.  Whether
the mute continues or is canceled is determined by the
<ref>Mute Cancel</ref> and <ref>Mute Cancel Functions</ref> parameters.
If the mute is not canceled
then the major mode will change and the loop may be modified, but it
will still continue to be silent.  You will continue to see <i>Mute</i>
appear as a minor mode.  This technique can be used to modify loops
while the audience can't hear them creating a surprise when the
loop is unmuted.</p>

<section><title id='modeOverdubMinor'>Overdub</title>

<p><i>Overdub</i> mode is active after executing
the <ref>Overdub</ref> or <ref>Sustain Overdub</ref> functions.
During <i>Overdub</i> mode any sound being received by the track will
be merged with the current content of the loop.</p>

<p><i>Overdub</i> mode is unusual because it is both a major and a minor
mode.  When the <i>Overdub</i> minor mode is active and no other

<section><title id='modePitchBend'>Pitch Bend</title>

<p><i>Pitch Bend</i> mode is active after executing the <ref id='functionPitchBend'>PitchBend</ref>
script function or more commonly after using the <ref id='controlPitchBend'>PitchBend</ref> control.
It indicates that the output of the loop is being passed through
a pitch shifting effect.   In the user interface the mode
will be displayed with a positive or negative number to indicate
the degree and direction of the bend.  For example "Pitch 3498" and
"Pitch -1287".  The range of values corresponds to the MIDI Pitch Bend range
with a minimum value of -8192 and a maximum of 8181.  A bend of zero 
means there is no pitch bend being applied.</p>

</section> <!-- PitchBend -->

<section><title id='modePitchOctave'>Pitch Octave</title>

<p><i>Pitch Octave</i> mode is active after executing the 
<ref id='functionPitchOctave'>PitchOctave</ref>
script function or more commonly using the <ref id='controlPitchOctave'>Pitch Octave</ref> control.
It indicates that the output of the loop is being passed through
a pitch shifting effect.   In the user interface the mode
will be displayed with a positive or negative number to indicate
the degree and direction of the shift in octaves.  For example "Pitch 1"
means up one octave and "Pitch -2" means down two octaves.</p>

</section> <!-- PitchOctave -->

<section><title id='modePitchStep'>Pitch Step</title>

<p><i>Pitch Step</i> mode is active after executing the

It indicates that the output of the loop is being passed through
a pitch shifting effect.   In the user interface the mode
will be displayed with a positive or negative number to indicate
the degree and direction of the shift in semitones.  For example "Pitch 5"
and "Pitch -2".</p>

<p><i>Speed Bend</i> mode is active after executing the <ref id='functionSpeedBend'>SpeedBend</ref>
script function or more commonly using the <ref id='controlSpeedBend'>Speed Bend</ref> control.  
This mode will be displayed with a number that indiciates the amount of speed change
in positive or negative units, for example "SpeedBend 3048" and "SpeedBend -578". 
Unlike most controls the value range is large to match the range of the MIDI

<section><title id='modeSpeedStep'>Speed Step</title>

<p><i>Speed Step</i> mode is active after executing <ref id='functionSpeedStep'>Speed Step</ref> 
or several other functions in the <i>Speed</i> function family.  
It indicates that the playback and record speed of the loop
is being adjusted in semitone steps.  The audible effect is that the
loop changes pitch but also speeds up or slows down.  In the user
interface the mode will be displayed a positive or negative number to
indicate the degree and direction of the change.  For example
"SpeedStep 5" and "SpeedStep -7".</p>

</section> <!-- SpeedStep -->

<section><title id='modeSpeedToggle'>Speed Toggle</title>

<p><i>Speed Toggle</i> mode is active after executing the
<ref id='functionSpeedToggle'>Speed Toggle</ref> or 
<ref>Sustain Speed Toggle</ref> functions.
It indiciates that a speed change in semitones is being applied, and that this change
will be canceled when one of the toggle fucntions is used again.  The mode will
be displayed with a number indiciating the amount of positive or negative speed change.
When running in half speed, it will display "SpeedToggle -12".</p>

<p>Note that releases of Mobius prior to 2.2 called this mode "1/2 Speed".  
In 2.2 this was generalized to support toggle between any semitone step.</p>

<section><title>Functions</title>

<section><title>Auto Record</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> AutoRecord</p>

<p><i>Auto Record</i> starts a loop recording that ends by itself
automatically after a configured number of bars.  The length of the
recording is determined by the <ref>Sync Source</ref>, 
<ref>Beats Per Bar</ref>, 
<ref>Auto Record Bars</ref>, and <ref>Auto Record Tempo</ref> parameters.
This is a <ref id='conceptModalFunction'>modal function</ref> that sets
the major mode to <ref id='modeRecord'>Record</ref> while it is active.  
Unlike most modal functions you do not have to execute another function to end 
<i>Record</i> mode, it will end by itself when the calculated number of
bars has been recorded.</p>

<p>The function is not sensitive to the <ref>Quantize Mode</ref> parameter,
it will cancel all major modes and execute immediately.  Unlike
<ref>Record</ref> this function does <b>not</b> cancel 
<ref id='conceptRounding'>rounding modes</ref>.</p>

<p>The function is sensitive to the <ref>Record Threshold</ref> parameter
which will defer the start of the recording until a loud enough
signal is received.  While waiting for a proper threshold the 
loop will be in <ref id='modeThreshold'>Threshold</ref> mode.</p>

<p>If the <ref>Sync Source</ref> parameter is set to <i>MIDI</i>
or <i>Host</i>, executing
this function may enter <ref id='modeSynchronize'>Synchronize</ref> 
mode temporarily waiting for the next sync pulse.</p>

<!-- TODO: Determine what this does to minor modes, does it leave them
in place or reset them?
-->

<p>To calculate the loop length the <ref>Beats Per Bar</ref>
setup parameter is multiplied by the <ref>Auto Record Bars</ref> preset 
parameter to get to the total number of beats to record.  This is then combined
with a tempo which determines the amount of time in each beat.  How
the tempo is determined depends on the <ref>Sync Source</ref> parameter.
When <i>Sync Source</i> is <i>MIDI</i> the
tempo is calculated from incoming MIDI clock messages.  When <i>Sync Source</i>
is <i>Host</i> the tempo is given to the plugin
by the host application.  When <i>Sync Source</i> is <i>Off</i>
or <i>Out</i> <b>and</b> this track is the <i>MIDI Sync Master</i> track,
the tempo is determined by the <ref>Auto Record Tempo</ref> parameter.</p>

<p>If the current track was recorded with <i>Track Sync</i> and is
following a master track, then a tempo is not used to calculate the
loop length.  Instead the total number of beats from <ref>Beats Per Bar</ref> 
and  <ref>Auto Record Bars</ref> is multiplied by the length of the
subcycle in the master track.</p>

<p>See <a href='techniques.htm#Record'>Record</a>
in the <i>Mobius Techniques</i> manual for more information.</p>

</section>

<section><title>Backward</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> Backward</p>

<p><i>Backward</i> forces the loop direction into reverse and sets
the <ref id='modeReverse'>Reverse</ref> minor mode.
Unlike the <ref>Reverse</ref> function this does not toggle <i>Reverse</i> 
mode,  if you are already in reverse the function has no effect.</p>

<p>This function will obey the <ref>Quantize Mode</ref> parameter.</p>

<p>Changing direction will end most major modes, see the documentation
for <ref>Reverse</ref> for a full list.  This function has no
effect on minor modes besides <i>Reverse</i>.</p>

<section><title>Bounce</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> Bounce</p>

<p><i>Bounce</i> is used to merge the contents of one or more tracks
and save the result to another track.  This is similar to "bouncing"
in traditional recording systems.  <i>Bounce</i> is really just a
special form of <ref id='Start Capture'>Capture</ref>.  If
the <i>Capture</i> minor mode is not active, <i>Bounce</i> behaves the
same as <ref>Start Capture</ref>, it will begin mixing the output of
all unmuted tracks and storing it in a temporary capture area.  When
the <i>Bounce</i> function is used during <i>Capture</i> mode it
end <i>Capture</i> mode and stores the captured audio in an empty
track loop.  After creating the new loop all tracks that were unmuted
at the time of the bounce will be muted, this mute is not
quantized.</p>

<p>The bounced recording will be placed in the first track from the
left that has an empty loop selected.  If there are no tracks with an
empty loop the bounce is discarded.  This function does not obey
the <ref>Quantize Mode</ref> parameter but it will obey the 
<ref>Bounce Quantize</ref> parameter.  This may delay the start and end of the
bounce if the active loop in the active track has content.  If the
active loop in the active track is empty then <ref>Bounce Quantize</ref> 
is ignored.</p>

<p><i>Bounce</i> will not end any major modes in progress when
the capture starts but muting the source tracks when the capture ends
will cancel all major modes.</p>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> Checkpoint</p>

<p><i>Checkpoint</i> creates a new layer checkpoint and collapses the

When you use the <ref>Undo</ref> and <ref>Redo</ref> functions to move
between layers, they will skip over any layers between two
checkpoints.</p>

<section><title>Divide</title>

<p><b>Internal names:</b> Divide, Divide2, Divide3, Divide4</p>

<p>The <i>Divide</i> functions cause an immediate reduction
in the loop size.  The amount of the reduction is determined by
the <i>divisor</i> which is the number in the name of the function.
<i>Divide 2</i> will divide the loop length in half, <i>Divide 3</i> 
will divide the loop length by 3, and <i>Divide 4</i> will divide
the loop length by 4.</p>

<p>The division functions are similar to the <ref>Instant Multiply</ref> 
functions except they work in the other direction, cutting the loop into
smaller pieces then selecting one of those pieces.  The division happens
immediately and a new layer is created with the shorter loop. You can
use <i>Undo</i> to return to the original loop.</p>

<p>The new loop will contain the portion of the original loop
that you were in at the time the function was executed.  For example
if a loop is 4 seconds long and you execute <i>Divide 2</i> while
the current loop location is at the end of second 1, the new
loop will contain seconds 1 and 2 of the original loop.  If instead
you execute <i>Divide 2</i> when the current loop location is at the
end of second  3, the new loop will contain seconds 3 and 4 of 
the original loop.</p>

<p>The function named just <i>Divide</i> without a number is
accessible only scripts.  With this function the divisor is
specified as an argument written after the function name.

<p><i>Multiply</i> is a complex function that can be used to both make
the loop longer and shorter.  It is influenced by the <ref>Multiply Mode</ref> parameter.  <i>Multiply</i> is a <i>major modal</i> function that
sets the mode to <ref id='modeMultiply'>Multiply</ref> while it is active.
<i>Multiply</i> is a <ref id='conceptRounding'>rounding</ref> mode that
will preserve the loop's cycle length unless you force rounding off.</p>

<p>After a loop has been recorded and still has only one cycle,
<i>Multiply</i> will make the loop larger by appending copies of the
original for as long as multiply mode is active.   Once a loop has more
than one cycle, <i>Multiply</i> can both extend the loop and resize it
to make it smaller.</p>

<p>The <ref>Record</ref> function has <i>modal behavior</i>
during <i>Multiply</i> mode.  It will cause an immediate termination of the
multiply without rounding and return the loop to <i>Play</i> or
<i>Overdub</i> mode.  This is called an "unrounded multiply".</p>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> Mute</p>

<p><i>Mute</i> will silence the loop.  Mute is a minor modal function
that will toggle <ref id='modeMuteMinor'>Mute</ref> mode.  
During mute mode the loop will continue to play, you will see loop
meter advancing in the user interface, but no sound will be sent out
from that track.</p>

<p>There are several options for what happens when you exit
mute mode, these are defined by the <ref>Mute Mode</ref> parameter.</p>

<p>You usually end mute mode by executing the <i>Mute</i> function again,
but you can also cancel mute mode automatically when other functions
are executed.  The <ref>Mute Cancel</ref> preset parameter
and <ref>Mute Cancel Functions</ref> global parameter
control which functions will cancel mute mode.</p>

<p>When the track being muted is the <i>MIDI Master Sync</i> track,
there are several options for what happens to the MIDI clocks being
generated.  This is controlled by the <ref>Out Sync Mute Action</ref>
parameter.</p>

<p><i>Mute</i> is an unusual mode because while it is primarily a 
minor mode, it will also be displayed as a major mode if there
are no other major modes active.  If <i>Mute</i> minor mode
is active and the loop enters the <ref>Play</ref> major mode,
the major mode is set to <i>Mute</i> instead.</p>

override it.  If you execute another major modal function,
the <i>Overdub</i> major mode will be canceled and overdubbing into

When pause mode is canceled the loop begins playing from its previous

an audio recorder.</p>

<p>Unlike <ref>Mute</ref>, <i>Pause</i> is always a major modal

that it must be bound to a trigger that supports a continuous range of
values such as MIDI notes or MIDI continuous controllers.  It is
almost always bound to a MIDI note from a keyboard so you can adjust
pitch shift chromatically by playing the keyboard normally.</p>

<p>The value of the note in the binding becomes the center point of the
shift range.  If you press this note the pitch returns to normal.  If you
press notes on either side of the center note, the pitch will be raised

<p><i>Speed Step</i> can change the playback speed of the loop up or
down to achieve a pitch change in a number of semitones.  It is
a <i>ranged</i> function which means that it must be bound to a
trigger that supports a continuous range of values such as MIDI notes
or MIDI continuous controllers.  It is almost always bound to a MIDI
note from a keyboard so you can adjust speed shift chromatically by
playing the keyboard normally.</p>

<p>The value of the note in the binding becomes the center point of the
shift range.  If you press this note the speed returns to normal.  If you
press notes on either side of the center note, the speed will be raised
or lowered by the corresponding number of semitones.  The range
of notes that will cause a speed shift is determined by the
<ref>Speed/Pitch Note Range</ref> global parameter.</p>

<p>If the amount of speed shift becomes non-zero, then 
the <ref id='modeSpeedStep'>Speed Step</ref> minor mode will become active
and displayed in the user interface.  If the speed shift becomes zero
(normal) then <i>SpeedStep</i> mode is canceled.</p>

<p>This function will obey the <ref>Quantize Mode</ref> parameter.</p>

<p>This function will not effect any other major or minor modes.</p>

<p><i>SpeedStep</i> may also be used in scripts but it is not ranged.

<p><b>Long press conversion:</b> Sustain Speed Toggle</p>

<p><i>Speed Toggle</i> allows you to activate and deactivate an amount
of speed shift with a single function binding.  By default it toggles
between shift of one octave down.  In releases prior to 2.2 this
was called simply <i>Speed</i> which would toggle you in and out of
<i>1/2 Speed</i> mode.</p>

<p>In release 2.2 this concept was generalized so that you can toggle
between a shift of any number of semitones up or down.  The number
of semitones may be specified as a number entered into the <i>Arguments</i>
field of the binding windows.  If an argument is not entered, the default
shift is -12, making it the same as the old <i>Speed</i> function.</p>

<p>When used in scripts, calling the function with a script argument
sets the toggle, and calling it with the same number or with no arguments
cancels the toggle.  See <a href='scripts.xml#SpeedToggle'>SpeedToggle</a> in the
<i>Mobius Scripting</i> manual for usage examples.</p>

<section><title>Substitute</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> Substitute</p>

<p><i>Substitute</i> allows you to replace a section of a loop with
new sounds, in a way similar to what traditional recording systems
call "punch in".  This is a major modal function that toggles
<ref id='modeSubstitute'>Substitute</ref> mode.  <i>Substitute</i>
is very similar to the <ref>Replace</ref> function but it gives you
more control over how new sound is combined with the current
contents of the loop.</p>

<p><i>Substitute</i> differs from  <ref>Replace</ref> in two ways.
First, during <i>Substitute</i> mode you
will continue to hear the contents of the loop that you are
replacing.  During <i>Replace</i> mode the current loop contents
are always muted.   Second, <i>Replace</i> will always completely
replace the current contents of the loop, <i>Substitute</i> allows
you to blend the new sounds with the old sounds by adjusting
the <ref>Secondary Feedback</ref> control.</p>

<p>To use <i>Substitute</i> with <ref>Secondary Feedback</ref>
you must check the <ref>Enable Secondary Feedback</ref> parameter.
When <i>Secondary Feedback</i> is all the way up, then <i>Substitute</i>
behaves like <ref>Overdub</ref>.  When <i>Secondary Feedback</i>
is all the way down, <i>Substitute</i> behaves like <ref>Replace</ref>.
If you bind the <i>Secondary Feedback</i> control to a MIDI continuous
controller, you can sweep secondary feedback up and down during
the substitute to "sculpt" the loop.</p>

<!-- TODO: I'm not really liking the difference between Replace
and Substitute.  There are really two variables here:

    - how much of the old layer is blended with the new layer (feedback)

    - how much of the old layer is heard during the mode

If we had ReplaceMonitor=true|false that would handle hearing
the old content.  It would also be interesting to hear the
replaced content at the level that it will be if secondary feedback
is enabled.  So that could be ReplaceMonitor=none|full|partial.
Then ReplaceMode=full|partial or else rely on Enable Secondary Feedback.

after the sustainable function trigger is released.  This is a useful
function if you want to make very short loops, where pressing
a trigger twice to start and end the recording would take too long.</p>

<p>The <ref>Record Threshold</ref> parameter can be used to delay the
start of the recording until an audio signal of sufficient loudness is
received.</p>

<p>The <ref>Record Speed Changes</ref> parameter determines whether
speed shifting functions such as <ref id='functionSpeedStep'>Speed Step</ref> 
and <ref id='functionSpeedToggle'>Speed Toggle</ref>

is made.</p>

<p>The <ref>Record Resets Feedback</ref> parameter can be used to 
reset the feedback control to the level specified in the track
setup whenever a recording is started.</p>

<p>Note that unlike <ref>Record</ref>, this function will not have
special modal behavior during <ref id='conceptRounding'>rounding</ref> modes.
The current mode is always canceled, the layers are freed, and a new

<p><i>Sustain Unrounded Insert</i> is the same as the <ref>Sustain Insert</ref>
function except that the ending of <ref id='modeInsert'>Insert</ref> mode will
not be <ref id='conceptRounding'>rounded</ref>.  Recall that
<i>rounding</i> is similar to quantization, it will delay the ending
of modes that add new space to a loop until the space added is an even
multiple of the cycle length.  This keeps the loop content at
a consistent tempo.  <i>Sustain Unrounded Insert</i> will not do rounding
so you can insert space of any size.  This is typically used when you
are creating "glitchy" or non-rhythmic loops.</p>

<p>Note that while <i>rounding</i> is not performed the start and end
of the <i>Insert</i> mode may be quantized.  If <ref>Quantize Mode</ref>
is set to <i>Subcycle</i> for example, a quick tap of the

any size out of the loop.
<ref id='modeMultiply'>Multiply</ref> mode is activated when the
function trigger is pressed, and it is canceled when the function trigger
is released.  When <i>Multiply</i> mode ends a new layer is created containing
only the loop content between the start and end of the mode.  
Both the beginning and ending of the multiply may
be quantized but the end will not be 
<ref id='conceptRounding'>rounded</ref>.</p>

<p>Recall that <i>rounding</i> is similar to quantization, it will delay
the ending of modes that add or remove loop space until the space added
or removed is an even multiple of the cycle length.  This keeps the loop
content at a consistent tempo.  <i>Sustain Unrounded Multiply</i> will not

<section><title>User Interface Functions</title>

<p>Functions beginning with the letters "UI" apply to the Mobius user
interface.  Most of these have no effect on how Mobius behaves, they
just change things in the user interface.  They are most commonly
bound to computer keyboard keys since you are usually not playing an
instrument when you use them.</p>

<p>These functions will not modify the loop in any way and will
not change any major or minor modes.</p>

  Preset Parameters

====================================================================== -->

<section><title>Preset Parameters</title>

<p>A <i>preset</i> is a named collection of parameters that effect how
looping functions will be performed.  While you can change parameters
individually using MIDI or scripts, you will usually change parameters
in bulk by selecting presets.</p>

<p>You may need only one preset, or you may define several with
parameters chosen for different looping styles.  Each track has
an <i>active preset</i> that may be changed at any time, even while a
loop is playing.  Each track may have a different active preset.</p>

<p>All preset parameters can be changed in scripts but these changes
are not permanent.  Parameters changed in scripts will only live until
a new preset is selected, or until the <ref>Track Reset</ref> or 
<ref>Global Reset</ref> functions are executed.</p>

<p>Some parameters are available for binding in the binding windows.
You would normally bind them to a trigger that can generate a range
of values such as a MIDI expression pedal.</p>

<section><title>Maximum Redo</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> maxRedo</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> an integer from 0 to infinity</p>

<p>This parameter controls how may layers will be kept for use by
the <ref>Redo</ref> function.  It is unset or set to zero, there will
be no redo layers.  The default value is 1.</p>

<section><title>Maximum Undo</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> maxUndo</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> an integer from 0 to infinity</p>

<p>This parameter controls how may old layers will be kept for use
with the <ref>Undo</ref> function.  It is unset or set to zero, there
is no limit on the number of layers.  The parameter is normally left
at zero but if you often create loops with many layers you should

will behave.  The possible values are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Normal</li>
<li>Simple</li>
</ul>

<p>The default value is <i>Normal</i> which will make <ref>Multiply</ref>
behave similar to the multiply function in the EDP.  When the value
is <i>Simple</i>, multiply will only add cycles when you reach the
end of the loop and otherwise will behave like the <ref>Overdub</ref>

<section><title>Mute Cancel</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> muteCancel</p>
<p><b>Internal values:</b> never, edit, trigger, effect, custom, always</p>

<p>This parameter controls whether mute mode is automatically
canceled when executing other functions.  The value may be the name
of a <i>function class</i> or it may be an explicit list of
function names.  See the <ref>Function Classes</ref> section for
more information on classes.  The possible values are:</p>

<glossary>

<gi><dt>Never</dt>
<dd>Mute mode is not canceled until you use another Mute function.
Note that mute may still be temporarily canceled with global
functions such as Solo.</dd>
</gi>

<gi><dt>Edits</dt>
<dd>Mute mode is canceled whenever a function that modifies
the loop is used.  This includes both the <i>Modal Edit</i> and
<i>Instant Edit</i> functions.</dd>
</gi>

<gi><dt>Triggers</dt>
<dd>Mute mode is canceled by the <i>Modal Edit</i> and <i>Instant Edit</i>
functions as well as the <i>Trigger</i> functions such as <i>Next Loop</i>,
<i>Restart</i>, etc.</dd>
</gi>

<gi><dt>Effects</dt>
<dd>Mute mode is canceled by the <i>Modal Edit</i>, <i>Instant Edit</i>,

such as <i>Reverse</i>, <i>Pitch Step</i>, <i>Speed Bend</i>, etc.</dd>
</gi>

<gi><dt>Custom</dt>
<dd>The functions that cancel mute mode may be individually selected.</dd>
</gi>

</glossary>

<p>When this parameter is set to <i>Custom</i> the functions that
cancel mute mode are defined by the global parameter named
<ref>Mute Cancel Functions</ref>.   Since this is a global parameter
it cannot have a different value in each preset.</p>

<section><title>Mute Mode</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> muteMode</p>
<p><b>Internal values:</b> continue, start, pause</p>

<p><i>Mute Mode</i> determines how the loop behaves when it
is taken out of <ref id='modeMuteMinor'>Mute</ref> mode.  
The possible values are:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Continue</b> - resume playing at the current playback location</li>
<li><b>Start</b> - restart the loop from the beginning</li>
<li><b>Pause</b> - resume from the paused location</li>
</ul>

<p>When this is set to <i>Pause</i> the <ref>Mute</ref> function
will behave the same as the <ref>Pause</ref> function.</p>

in the <i>Mobius Techniques</i> manual for more information.</p>

<!-- TODO: Not really liking Pause here, just make them use the 
Pause function, it's simpler because it doesn't cloudy up how

<section><title>No Feedback Undo</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> noFeedbackUndo</p>
<p><b>Internal values:</b> true, false</p>

<p>This parameter determines whether feedback reduction alone will
cause the creation of a new layer for undo.  A layer is created
whenever the loop is changed with functions such as <ref>Overdub</ref>
or <ref>Replace</ref>.  When feedback is reduced the loop is also
being edited, each pass through the loop the level is reduced slightly
until it decays to nothing.</p>

<p>When this parameter is false, every time the loop plays with
feedback reduced a new layer is created, even if no other changes
were made to the loop.  This allows you to use the <ref>Undo</ref>
function to undo the feedback effect.  If you let the loop play
for a long time with reduced feedback this can result in
the creation of many layers.</p>

<p>When this parameter is true, a new layer will not be created if the
only change to the loop during the last pass was caused by feedback.
This can significantly reduce the amount of memory required for your
loops.</p>

<p>This parameter determines whether
the <i>Overdub</i> minor mode will be carried over from the current
loop to the next loop during a loop switch.  The possible values are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Off - Overdub will be forced off in the next loop</li>
<li>Follow - Overdub will be carried over from the current loop to the next loop</li>
<li>Restore - Overdub will be restored to the state it had the last time the next loop was active</li>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> pitchBendRange</p>
<p><b>Value range:</b> 1 to 48</p>
<p><b>Default value:</b> 12</p>

<p>This parameter defines the range of the
<ref id='controlPitchBend'>Pitch Bend</ref> control.  
The default value of 12 means that the range is
12 semitones, or 1 octave up and down for a total range of 24 semitones.
The smallest value is 1 which gives you a range of 2 semitones, 
one up and one down.</p>

<p>You may wish to lower the bend range when binding to a MIDI
continuous controller to give you a smoother and more subtle bend.</p>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> pitchStepRange</p>
<p><b>Value range:</b> 1 to 48</p>
<p><b>Default value:</b> 24</p>

<p>This parameter defines the range of the
<ref id='controlPitchStep'>Pitch Step</ref> control.  
The default value of 24 means that the range is
24 semitones, or 2 octaves up and down for a total range of 48 semitones.
The smallest value is 1 which gives you a range of 2 semitones, 
one up and one down.</p>

<p>You may wish to lower the step range when binding to a MIDI
continuous controller to give you more control when selecting steps.
If the range is too high, very slight changes to the knob or pedal 
will change pitchs.  With a lower range, the knob or pedal must
move a longer distance before changing pitchs.</p>

<section><title>Setup Parameters</title>

<p>The track setup contains several parameters that apply to the
collection of tracks as a whole.  Most of these are related
to synchronization.</p>

<section><title>Active Track</title>

<p>This parameter specifies the number of the track that will be selected
when the track setup is selected, or when a <i>Global Reset</i> is performed.</p>

<p>This parameter is not accessible in scripts.</p>

<section><title>Beats Per Bar</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> beatsPerBar</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> an integer from 1 to 512</p>

<p>This parameter specifies the number of synchronization beats in one
bar of music.  What a "bar" actually represents is flexible, often it
represents a "measure" in standard music notation but it may represent
something larger.  If this parameter is not set or set to zero, then
the <ref>Subcycles</ref> parameter is used instead.  It is recommended
that you set <i>Beats Per Bar</i> to a non-zero value so that
<ref>Subcycles</ref> may be used for quantization without impacting
the bar size.</p>

<p>The parameter is used in three places.</p>

<ul>
<li>During <i>MIDI Slave Sync</i> to set the bar size of the incoming MIDI clocks</li>
<li>During <i>MIDI Master Sync</i> to calculate the tempo of the generated MIDI clocks</li>
<li>With the <i>Auto Record</i> function to calculate the length of the recording</li>
</ul>

====================================================================== -->

<section><title>Track Controls</title>

<p>Track controls are really just <ref>Track Parameters</ref> but we
call them <i>controls</i> because the values of these parameters is
different than the others.  A control value ranges from 0 to 127 and
is almost always bound to a MIDI expression pedal.</p>

<section><title>Feedback</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> feedback</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> 0 to 127</p>

<p><i>Feedback</i> controls how the loop decays over time.  With
feedback set at <i>127</i> the loop does not decay, it will play that
way forever or until you change it with looping functions.  With
feedback reduced the loop will gradually become softer every time it
plays until it eventually decays to silence.  A common looping
technique is to use <ref>Overdub</ref> with feedback reduced.  You can
keep adding new layers to the loop but old layers will decay.  In this
way you can create evolving loops that change gradually over time.</p>

<p>See <a href='starting.htm#Using Feedback'>Using Feedback</a> 
in the <i>Getting Started With Mobius</i> manual for more information.</p>

</section> <!-- Feedback -->

<section><title>Input Level</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> input</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> 0 to 127</p>

<p><i>Input Level</i> controls the amount of attenuation (volume
reduction) applied to the audio stream coming in from the audio
interface or the plugin host.  A value of <i>127</i> means that the
audio is unmodified.  Lowering the value attenuates the audio using
an approximate logarithmic curve.  Usually input level is left all the
way up, but you may want to reduce it if you have different
instruments routed to each track and you want to balance their input
levels.</p>

</section> <!-- Input Level -->

<section><title>Output Level</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> output</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> 0 to 127</p>

<p><i>Output Level</i> controls the amount of attenuation applied to
the track output as it is sent to the audio device or plugin host.
Like <ref>Input Level</ref> a value of <i>127</i> means the is passed
unmodified.  Output levels are frequently changed to balance the track
mix.  Functions that add new material to a loop such as <i>Overdub</i>
can cause a loop to become progressively louder.  After several
overdubs it may be necessary to reduce the output level to match the
other tracks.  Output levels are also commonly changed as an effect,
such as temporarily muting tracks or performing a gradual fade in or
fade out.</p>

<section><title>Pan</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> pan</p>

<p><i>Pitch Bend</i> is used to make continuous adjustments
to the loop pitch.  Unlike <ref id='controlPitchStep'>Pitch Step</ref>
the adjustments are much more gradual and smooth.  This control
is most effective when bound to a MIDI <i>Pitch Wheel</i>.  You
may also bind it to a MIDI <i>Continuous Controller</i> but the pitch

<p><i>Pitch Octave</i> is used to make adjustments
to the loop pitch in jumps of one octave.  When bound to a MIDI

<p><b>Internal value:</b> -48 to 48</p>

<p><i>Pitch Step</i> is used to make adjustments
to the loop pitch in jumps of one semitone.  When bound to a MIDI
continuous controller, the center position of the control will 
cause no pitch shift.   Moving the control down will lower the
pitch.</p>

<p>It is very similar to the <ref id='functionPitchStep'>Pitch Step</ref>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> 16BitWaveFile</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> true, false</p>

<p>When this boolean parameter is true, Mobius will
save all audio samples as 16-bit integers when writing <i>.wav</i>
files.  It is found under the <i>Miscellaneous</i> tab of
the <i>Global Parameters</i> window.</p>

<p>If this is not enabled, samples are stored as 32-bit floating
point numbers.  32-bit is usually preferred because it provides
greater dynamic range, but not all audio applications are able to 
open 32-bit files.  If you have trouble loading a file that Mobius
saves try saving it in 16-bit mode.</p>

<p>This parameter has the name of the MIDI binding set that will
be merged with the default binding set.  Unlike most global
parameters this one is set in the <i>MIDI Control</i> window,
if you leave a binding set selected other than the first one.</p>

<p>In scripts, the value will be a string containing the name
of the binding set.  Since binding set names often contain spaces
you must remember to surround the name in quotes.</p>

<section><title>Confirmation Functions</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> confirmationFunctions</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> comma separated list of function names</p>

<p>This parameter contains the names of functions that will cause a
loop switch to be confirmed when
in <ref id='modeConfirm'>Confirm</ref> mode.  By default the list
is empty, but past EDP users may wish to add <ref>Undo</ref> to the list
since this is what the EDP always uses for switch confirmation.</p>

<p>The <ref>Confirm</ref> function does not need to be on this list,
it is always a switch confirmation function.</p>

<p>In scripts the value of this parameter will be a string containing
a comma separated list of function names.</p>

<section><title>Custom Message File</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> customMessageFile</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> message file name</p>

<p>This parameter is used to specify a alternative file containing the
text that Mobius uses in the user interface.  It is found under
the <i>Miscellaneous</i> tab of the <i>Global Parameters</i> window.
The default message file is <i>Catalog_USEnglish.txt</i>.</p>

<p>Creating custom message files can be used if you need to shorten or
otherwise change some of the text seen in the user interface.  It can
also be used if you want to translate the text into another language.
This is recommended only for advanced users since the contents of the
message file can change at every Mobius release and it can become
difficult to synchronize the custom files.  If you have a change you
think should be in the default message files contact us.</p>

<p>This parameter cannot be set from scripts.</p>

<section><title>Drift Check Point</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> driftCheckPoint</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> loop, external</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b>  This is an experimental parameter that is not visible
in the user interface.  If you feel you need to use this parameter
please contact us.</p>

<p>This parameter determines when Mobius will check to see if
synchronized loops have drifted away from the master clock.  The
possible values are:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>loop</b> - at the start point of the Mobius loop (the default)</li>
<li><b>external</b> - at the start point of the external loop</li>
</ul>

<p>When set to <i>external</i> we check for sync drift every time the
external loop reaches the start point.  The external start point is 
defined by the number of "pulses" counted when the loop was first
recorded.  When syncing to MIDI clocks a pulse is a MIDI clock, when
syncing to VST beats a pulse is a VST beat, when syncing to a VST bar
a pulse is a VST bar, etc.</p>

<p>Every time we receive this number of pulses we are at the external
loop start point.  For example, when syncing from MIDI clocks, a loop
is recorded for 96 clocks.  After recording we continue to count MIDI
clocks wrapping back to zero every time we count up to 96.  When we
wrap back to zero, this is the external start point.</p>

<p><b>Script example:</b></p>
<pre>
    set driftCheckPoint external
</pre>

<p>See <a href='synchronization.htm#Drift Correction'>Drift Correction</a>
in the <i>Mobius Synchronization</i> manual for more information.</p>

</section> <!-- Drift Check Point -->

<section><title>Drift Resync Frames</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> maxSyncDrift</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> an integer from 256 to infinity</p>

<p>This parameter has the number of frames Mobius will allow a loop 
to drift out of sync with a master clock before it is corrected
to bring it back into alignment.  It is found under the <i>Advanced</i>
tab of the <i>Global Parameters</i> window.</p>

<p>This parameter may be set from scripts though there is never a need
to do so.  This is something you normally set once when tuning a new
installation, then you leave it that way until something significant
changes, like getting a new MIDI interface.</p>

<p>The useful range is between 1000 and 10000.  The default value is 2048.
Some amount of drift is unavoidable due to clock jitter and tends
to correct itself over time.  It is not recommended that you set this
value below 1000 or excessive and unnecessary correction may occur.
If you set the value too high drift will not be corrected.</p>

<p>See <a href='synchronization.htm#Drift Correction'>Drift Correction</a>

<section><title>Dual Plugin Edit Window</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> dualPluginWindow</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> true, false</p>

<p>This parameter controls the number of windows that will be opened
when using Mobius as a VST plugin.  It is found under
the <i>Miscellaneous</i> tab of the <i>Global Parameters</i> window.</p>

<p>Most plugins open an single "edit" window to change the plugin
parameters.  But this window is controlled by the host application and
it has several important restrictions.  The host's window can't be
resized which is often desirable after customizing the Mobius user
interface.  Events from the computer keyboard are also passed
inconsistently which means you might not be able to use all of key and
shift combinations as Mobius function triggers.</p>

<p>When this option is enabled, Mobius will open two edit windows,
the first is the window controlled by the host application, which will
be small and contain only the Mobius icon.  The second will
be an independent window containing the Mobius user interface.  Because
this window is not controlled by the host, it can be resized and
will receive all keyboard events.</p>

<p>This option is only available for VST plugins under Windows.
It is not available for either VST or Audio Unit plugins
on the Mac.</p>

<p>This parameter cannot be set from scripts.</p>.

<section><title>Fade Frames</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> fadeFrames</p>
<p><b>Internal name:</b> an integer from 0 to infinity</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> This is an experimental parameter that is not
accessible from the user interface.  If you feel you have a need for
this parameter please contact us.</p>

<p>Mobius performs a cross fade whenever playback must change abruptly
such as when performing an unquantized loop switch, a loop restart,
or a replace.  The value of this parameter is the length of this fade
in frames.</p>

<p>This is necessary to prevent "snapping" or "clicking" sounds during
playback caused by sudden changes in sample level.  The default
value is 128 and there is rarely a need to change it.  The value
cannot be set below 16 because this would increase the chance of
audible artifacts.  It cannot be set higher than 256 because the size
is used in the allocation of stack buffers which must be limited.</p>

<p>Originally this could be set from the <i>Global Parameters</i>
window with the intent that users could set it to a very high value to
get "pumping" and "breathing" effects.  With the introduction of the
256 maximum size, this is no longer possible and since 256 
doesn't sound much different than 128 the parameter is 
no longer exposed.</p>

<p>We may restore the ability to set long fade times, if you have
used this in the past please contact us.</p>

<section><title>Focus Lock Functions</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> focusLockFunctions</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> a comma separated list of function names</p>

<p>This parameter specifies which functions will be sensitive to focus
lock.  It is found under the <i>Functions</i> tab of the <i>Global
Parameters</i> window.</p>

<p>In XML this is represented by the <i>FocusLockFunctions</i> element.</p>

<p>In scripts the value is a string containing a comma separated list
of internal function names.</p>

<section><title>Groups Have Focus Lock</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> groupFocusLock</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> true, false</p>

<p>This boolean parameter determines whether track groups are
to have <i>focus lock</i> behavior.  It is found in the <i>Miscellaneous</i>
tab of the <i>Global Parameters</i> window.  The default value is <i>false</i>.</p>

<p>See <a href='exploring.htm#Focus Lock'>Focus Lock</a> 
and <a href='exploring.htm#Track Groups and Focus Lock'>Track Groups and Focus Lock</a>

<section><title>Host MIDI Status Export</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> hostMidiExport</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> true, false</p>

<p>This parameter causes MIDI messages to be sent to the plugin host
whenever certain Mobius controls or parameters are changed from the
user interface or from scripts.  It is found under
the <i>Miscellaneous</i> tab of the <i>Global Parameters</i> window.
This parameter is only relevant when running Mobius as a plugin.  The
purpose of this parameter is to keep bi-directional MIDI control
surfaces in sync with the actual Mobius state.</p>

<p><b>Script example:</b></p>
<pre>
    set hostMidiExport true
</pre>

<p>See <a href='exploring.htm#MIDI Status Export'>MIDI Status Export</a>

</section> <!-- Host MIDI Status Export -->

<section><title>Input Latency</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> inputLatency</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> an integer from 0 to infinity</p>

<p>This parameter has the number of frames of input latency used for
latency compensation.  Unlike most global parameters this is not set
in the <i>Global Parameters</i> window.  Instead it is set in the
<i>Audio Devices</i> window when you select an audio device. If you
entered a value in the <i>Override Input Latency Frames</i> field that
will be the initial value of the <i>inputLatency</i> parameter.  If you
did not specify an override the parameter will have a value returned by
the device driver for the audio interface.</p>

<p>You can set this parameter from a script but this is not
recommended.  If you read some of the Mobius test scripts you will see
the latency being set but that is only done so the tests can run with
the same latency compensation levels for any audio device.  We have
never heard of a legitimate reason for users to set this
parameter.</p>

</section> <!-- Input Latency -->

<section><title>Isolate Overdubs</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> isolateOverdubs</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> true, false</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> This is an experimental parameter that is not
accessible from the user interface.  This is no longer exposed in the
user interface because it is hard to explain, it isn't obvious when it
has been enabled, and it can up to double the amount of memory
required for each layer.  If you feel you have a need for this
parameter please contact us.</p>

<p>This is a boolean parameter that when true will cause Mobius to
save an independent copy of the new audio content added to each layer.
This copy will be saved as a <i>.wav</i> file when you save a project.
Normally, new content that is overdubbed in a layer is merged with
content carried over from the previous layer in a process called
"flattening".  When a project is saved the <i>.wav</i> file for the
layer contains both the new content and the content from previous
layers.  When the <i>Isolate Overdubs</i> option is on, the project
saves two <i>.wav</i> files for each layer, one containing the
flattened content, and one containing only the new content overdubbed
during the recording of the layer.</p>

</section> <!-- Isolate Overdubs -->

<section><title>Long Press Milliseconds</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> longPress</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> an integer from 100 to infinity</p>

<p>This parameter has the number of milliseconds that Mobius will wait
while a sustainable trigger is held in its "down" state before
performing the <i>long press behavior</i>.  It is found under
the <i>Miscellaneous</i> tab of the <i>Global Parameters</i> window.</p>

<p>Several functions have long press behavior, the <i>Record</i>
function for example will convert to the <i>Reset</i> function if the
trigger is held down.  Scripts will also receive notification if the
long press time has been reached and may take special action.  IF a
function has long press behavior it will be mentioned in the reference
section for that function.</p>

<p>The default value is 500 (1/2 second) which is acceptable to most
people.  Normally you do not set the value lower than this because it
becomes easier to cause the long press behavior accidentally just by
lingering a little on the switch.  Setting it higher will give
you more time to release the switch.</p>

<p><b>Script example:</b></p>
<pre>
    set longPress 1000
</pre>

</section> <!-- Long Press Milliseconds -->

<section><title>Max Loops Per Track</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> maxLoops</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> an integer from 1 to 16</p>

<p>This parameter has the maximum number of loops that are allowed in
each track.  It is found under the <i>Limits</i> tab of the <i>Global
Parameters</i> window.  The default is 4.  Note that this does not by
itself specify how many loops will be in a track, that is done by the
preset parameter <i>Loop Count</i>.  For example, <i>Max Loops Per
Track</i> may be 8 but if <i>Loop Count</i> is 4 the track will only
have 4 loops.</p>

<p>Setting this parameter is important if you have chosen to add the
<a href='exploring.htm#loopStatusStrip'>Loop Status</a> component to
the track strip.  This component displays a vertical column of
rectangles representing the loops in a track.  Because the actual
number of loops is determined by the <i>Loop Count</i> preset
parameter, each track may contain a different number of loops.  But
while tracks can have different numbers of loops, the height of this
component must be the same in all tracks.  The <i>Max Loops Per Track</i>
determines the height of the <i>Loop Status</i> component.  If the
track has fewer than this number of loops, the component will just
display empty space at the bottom.</p>

<p>Because people usually want the track strip to be as short as possible,
you should think about the number of loops you will actually need
in each track so you don't waste space in the track strip.  If you
don't use the <i>Loop Status</i> component then this parameter is
ignored.</p>

<p>It is not meaningful to set this parameter from a script because
changing will not cause the user interface to be redrawn.  The value
can only be set from the <i>Global Parameters</i> window, and it will
only take effect when you restart Mobius.</p>

</section> <!-- Max Loops Per Track -->

<section><title>Message Duration</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> messageDuration</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> an integer from 0 to infinity</p>

<p>This has the number of seconds that messages generated by the <i>Message</i>
script function will appear in the user interface.  This is found under
the <i>Miscellaneous</i> tab of the <i>Global Parameters</i> window.</p>

<p>The default value is 2.  If you set this to 0, messages will be shown
continuously until they are changed.</p>

<p>To see messages you must also have the <i>Messages</i> component
enabled in the status area.  See <a href='exploring.htm#Components'>Components</a> in the <i>Exploring Mobius</i> manual for more information on 
customizing the user interface.</p>

<section><title>MIDI Input</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> midiInput</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> a comma separated list of device names</p>

<p>This parameter has the names of the MIDI devices that have
been selected for input when running in standalone mode.  This is 
not set in the <i>Global Parameters</i> window, it is set from the 
<i>Input Devices</i> panel in the <i>MIDI Devices</i> window.</p>

<p>When used in a script the value will be a string containing
a comma separated list of device names.   Setting this value in

output devices whenever certain Mobius controls or parameters are
changed from the user interface or from scripts.  It is found under
the <i>Miscellaneous</i> tab of the <i>Global Parameters</i>
window.</p>

<p>The purpose of this parameter is to keep bi-directional MIDI
control surfaces in sync with the actual Mobius state.  It is relevant
for both standalone and plugin modes, but if you want status exports
from the plugin you will need to select plugin MIDI devices in
the <i>MIDI Devices</i> window.</p>

selected as a "through" device when running in standalone mode.  This
is not set in the <i>Global Parameters</i> window, it is set from the
<i>Through Device</i> panel in the <i>MIDI Devices</i> window.</p>

<p>A "through" device will immediately receive a copy of every
MIDI message that comes in on all the selected input devices.  There
is rarely a need to select a MIDI through device.  Unlike the
parameters for input and output devices, there can only be one
through device.</p>

<p>When used in a script the value will be a string containing the
device name.  Setting this value in a script will have no effect until
Mobius is restarted.</p>

<p>This is a relatively useless parameter, but you could use
it in a script to take different actions depending on the MIDI
devices being used.</p>

<section><title>Modes Ignoring Secondary Feedback</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> altFeedbackDisable</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> a comma separated list of mode names</p>

<p>This parameter has the names of the recording modes that
will <b>not</b> respond to the <i>Secondary Feedback</i> control.  It
is found under the <i>Modes</i> tab of the <i>Global Parameters</i>
window.</p>

<p>Secondary feedback must first be enabled with the
<ref>Enable Secondary Feedback</ref> preset parameter.  When this
is enabled, the following recording modes will by default use secondary feedback
rather than primary feedback.</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiply</li>
<li>Overdub</li>
<li>Stutter</li>
<li>Substitute</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not want these modes to use secondary feedback, add the
mode name to the <i>Modes Ignoring Secondary Feedback</i> parameter using
the item selector.</p>

<p>In <i>Replace</i> mode, the feedback level is always zero.</p>

<p>In <i>Insert</i> mode, there is no background content so feedback
is not relevant.</p>

<p>In all other modes recording is not active so feedback is not relevant.</p>

<p>The parameter is stored in the <i>mobius.xml</i> file as the <i>AltFeedbackDisables</i>
element.</p>

<p>In scripts, the value is a string containing a comma separated list of mode names.</p>

<p>This parameter contains the names of functions that will cause
an immediate cancellation of 
<ref id='modeMuteMinor'>Mute</ref> or <ref id='modePause'>Pause</ref> mode.
It is found under the <i>Functions</i> tab of the 
<i>Global Parameters</i> window.</p>

<p>By default, mute mode is only canceled by executing the
<i>Mute</i> function a second time, or by executing the <i>Play</i>,
<i>Record</i> or <i>Reset</i> functions.
Other loop editing functions like <i>Overdub</i> will not cancel
<i>Mute</i> mode.  This can be used in advanced looping techniques where a
loop is muted and then modified without the audience hearing it while
it is being modified. Then the loop is unmuted and the audience hears
the result.</p>

<p>In scripts the value of this parameter will be a string containing
a comma separated list of function names.</p>

<p><b>Script example:</b></p>
<pre>
    set muteCancelFunctions Overdub,Multiply

<!-- TOOD: Need to decide how Pause is canceled.
Should be able to change speed, pitch, and direction
during pause mode without canceling the pause?  Could
use Mute Cancel Functions for this but that let's you do things

to cancel the pause, though I suppose you could queue them and
execute them after unpausing....

<section><title>Noise Floor</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> noiseFloor</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> an integer from 0 to 65535</p>

<p>This parameter determines the minimum signal level that is
considered to be "significant" enough when overdubbing to cause the
generation of a new layer.  It is found under the <i>Miscellaneous</i>
tab of the <i>Global Parameters</i> window.</p>

<p>When <i>Overdub</i> mode is active and new content is added to the
loop, a new layer is usually generated at the end of each pass over
the loop.  If the new audio content is below the noise floor however,
a new layer is not generated.  This allows you to leave overdub on and
listen to the loop a few times without having unnecessary layers
generated on each pass.</p>

<p>The EDP calls this feature "auto undo".</p>

<p>If the value is too low, a new layer will be generated every 
pass through the loop because string noise, AC buzz, or crowd noise
is enough to make Mobius think that something important has been recorded.
If the value is too high, Mobius may decide not to keep an overdub even
if you were playing your heart out.</p>

<section><title>Output Latency</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> outputLatency</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> an integer from 0 to infinity</p>

<p>This parameter has the number of frames of output latency used for
latency compensation.  Unlike most global parameters this is not set
in the <i>Global Parameters</i> window.  Instead it is set in the
<i>Audio Devices</i> window when you select an audio device. If you
entered a value in the <i>Override Output Latency Frames</i> field that
will be the initial value of the <i>outputLatency</i> parameter.  If you
did not specify an override the parameter will have a value returned by
the device driver for the audio interface.</p>

<p>You can set this parameter from a script but this is not
recommended.  If you read some of the Mobius test scripts you will see
the latency being set but that is only done so the tests can run with
the same latency compensation levels for any audio device.  We have
never heard of a legitimate reason for users to set this
parameter.</p>

</section> <!-- Output Latency -->

<section><title>Periodic Status Log</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> logStatus</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> true or false</p>

<p>This parameter enables printing of Mobius memory consumption
and track structure once a minute.  It is normally off unless you
are working with developers to diagnose a memory problem.</p>

</section>

<section><title>Plugin MIDI Inputs</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> pluginMidiInput</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> a comma separated list of device names</p>

<p>This parameter has the names of the MIDI devices that have
been selected for input when running in plugin mode.  This
is not set in the <i>Global Parameters</i> window, it is set from the 
<i>Plugin Input Devices</i> panel in the <i>MIDI Devices</i> window.</p>

<p>When used in a script the value will be a string containing
a comma separated list of device names.   Setting this value in 
a script will have no effect until Mobius is restarted.</p>

<p>This is a relatively useless parameter, but you could use
it in a script to take different actions depending on the MIDI
devices being used.</p>

</section> <!-- Plugin MIDI Inputs -->

<section><title>Plugin MIDI Outputs</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> pluginMidiOutput</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> a comma separated list of device names</p>

<p>This parameter has the names of the MIDI devices that have
been selected for output when running in plugin mode.  This is 
set in the <i>Plugin Output Devices</i> panel in the
<i>MIDI Devices</i> window.</p>

<p>When used in a script the value will be a string containing
a comma separated list of device names.   Setting this value in 
a script will have no effect until Mobius is restarted.</p>

</section> <!-- Plugin MIDI Outputs -->

<section><title>Plugin MIDI Through</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> pluginMidiThrough</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> a device name</p>

<p>This parameter has the name of the MIDI devices that has
been selected for "through" when running in plugin mode.  It is
set in the <i>Plugin Through Device</i> panel in the
<i>MIDI Devices</i> window.</p>

<p>If a through device is selected, any MIDI messages received from
all the input devices will be immediately echoed to the through
device.  Unlike the parameters for input and output devices, you can
only select one through device.</p>

<p>When used in a script the value will be a string containing
the device name.  Setting this value in a script
will have no effect until Mobius is restarted.</p>

</section> <!-- Plugin MIDI Through -->

<section><title>Plugin Ports</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> pluginPorts</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> an integer from 2 to 64</p>

<p>This parameter specifies the number of input and output pins we
will expose to the VST or Audio Units plugin host.  It is set
under the <i>Limits</i> tab of the <i>Global Parameters</i> window.
The default is 8 ports which corresponds to 16 pins.</p>

<p>Some hosts may refuse to load plugins that have more than one pair
of stereo input and output channels.  If you have a host that will not
the insert the Mobius plugin, try reducing the number of channels.</p>

<p>This is discussed in more detail in the
<a href='installation.htm#Plugin Pins'>Plugin Pins</a> section
of the <i>Installation Guide</i>.</p>

</section> <!-- Plugin Ports -->

<section><title>Quick Save File</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> quickSave</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> file name</p>

<p>This parameter has the file system path to the file where the
current loop is saved when selecting the <i>Save Quick</i> menu item
or using the <ref>Save Loop</ref> function.  It is found under
the <i>Miscellaneous</i> tab of the <i>Global Parameters</i>
window.</p>

<p>The name must not include the <b>.wav</b> extension.  The actual
name of the file will be derived from the specified path plus a number
to make the name unique.  This allows you to use the <i>Save Quick</i>
item several times without overwriting the previous file that was
saved.</p>

<p><b>Script example:</b></p>
<pre>
    set quickSave c:\temp\mobiusloop
    set quickSave /Users/Jeff/loops/mobiusloop
</pre>

<p>See <a href='exploring.htm#Quick Save'>Quick Save</a>
in the <i>Exploring Mobius</i> manual for more information.</p>

</section> <!-- Quick Save File -->

<section><title>Speed/Pitch Note Range</title>

<!-- TODO: Consider moving this to the setup or preset -->

<p><b>Internal name:</b> shiftRange</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> an integer from 1 to 128</p>

<p>This parameter defines the range of MIDI notes or controller values
that will be automatically bound to the <ref id='functionSpeedStep'>Speed Step</ref>
or <ref id='functionPitchStep'>Pitch Step</ref> functions.  The center of the range
is defined by the note or control selected in the binding window.
The parameter is found under the <i>Miscellaneous</i> tab of
the <i>Global Parameters</i> window.</p>

<p>For example, if you bind MIDI note number 60 (middle C) to the
<i>Speed Step</i> function and the <i>Speed/Pitch Note Range</i>
parameter is 12, you will have a two octave range of speed shift available.
The center note 60 will be normal, 61 will be one semitone higher, 
59 will be one semitone lower, etc.  Note that the number defines the
number of semitones in one direction, so 12 means 12 semitones up and
12 semitones down for a total range of 24.</p>

<p>This allows you to play loops chromatically without having to 
manually bind every note in the range, you just bind the center note
and Mobius automatically takes care of the rest of the note range.</p>

<p>If you select a wide range, the bindings may conflict with other
binding you made in the <i>MIDI Control</i> window.  If there is a
conflict, the explicit binding seen in the <i>MIDI Control</i> will
have priority.  For example if you have <i>Speed Step</i> bound to
note 60 with a range of 12 and you have <i>Record</i> bound to note
50, notes 49 and 51 will do a speed shift but 50 will do a record.
These "holes" in the shift range make shift hard to use so if you need
a wide range it is recommended that you select a single MIDI channel
just for speed or pitch shift notes and put all your other MIDI
bindings on another channel.</p>

<p><b>Script example:</b></p>
<pre>
    set shiftRange 48
</pre>

<!-- TODO: Need something in exploring.htm in the 
Advanced Binding section on ranged functions -->

</section> <!-- Speed/Pitch Note Range -->

<section><title>Reduce Feedback During Overdub</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> autoFeedbackReduction</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> true, false</p>

<p>This is a boolean parameter that when true will cause an automatic
5% reduction in feedback during <i>Overdub</i>, <i>Multiply</i>,
and <i>Stutter</i> modes when the <i>Feedback</i> control is set to
the maximum value of 127.  It is found under the <i>Miscellaneous</i>
tab of the <i>Global Parameters</i> window.</p>

<p>Enabling this parameter can reduce the chance of harsh digital
clipping when overdubbing because a small amount of feedback will
always be applied.  Even when enabled though it is still possible to
reach clipping if your overdubs are very loud.</p>

<p><b>Script examples:</b></p>
<pre>
     set altFeedbackReduction true
     set altFeedbackReduction false
</pre>

<p>See <a href='techniques.htm#Reduce Feedback During Overdub'>Reduce Feedback During Overdub</a> in the <i>Mobius Techniques</i> 
manual for more information.</p>

</section> <!-- Reduce Feedback During Overdub -->

<section><title>Save Project Layers</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> saveLayers</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> true, false</p>

<p>This is a boolean parameter that when true will cause the complete
layer history to be saved with a project.  It is found under
the <i>Advanced</i> tab of the <i>Global Parameters</i> window.</p>

<p>Normally when a project is saved, only one <i>.wav</i> file is
created for each loop that contains the most recent layer.  When this
parameter is set, we will save one <i>.wav</i> file for every layer in
the loop.  There are two reasons you might want to set this.  First
you can use the layer history as raw material when creating audio files
in a traditional DAW or audio editor.  Second, you can reload the
layer history in Mobius so that you can use the <i>Undo</i> function
as a performance technique even after saving and loading a project.</p>

<p>Usually this is disabled because it requires extra disk space
for the project.</p

<p><b>BUG ALERT:</b> There are problems restoring projects saved with layers,
we recommend you do not use this parameter if you intend to load
the projects back into Mobius.</p>

<p>See <a href='exploring.htm#Projects'>Projects</a> 
in the <i>Exploring Mobius</i> manual for more information.</p>

</section> <!-- Save Project Layers -->

<section><title>Selected Track</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> selectedTrack</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> an integer from 1 to 32</p>

<p>This parameter has the number of the currently selected track and
is intended for use only in scripts.
This is not set in the <i>Global Parameters</i> window, you
select tracks by clicking on them in the main window or by
using one of the track selection functions.</p>

<p>The number of the first track is 1.  In a script this parameter
may be both read and set, when set it will change the selected track.
You can also change the selected track with the <ref>Track</ref>
function which is the preferred way to change tracks.</p>

<p><b>Script example:</b></p>
<pre>
    set selectedTrack 2
</pre>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Use of this parameter is not recommended, the parameter
may be removed in a future release.  Use the <ref>Track</ref> functions
instead to select tracks.</p>

<!-- TODO: If we're going to keep this make it a settable
Variable instead of a global parameter
-->

</section> <!-- Selected Track -->

<section><title id='setupParameter'>Setup</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> setup</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> setup number</p>

<p>This parameter has the number of the currently selected track setup.
This is not set in the <i>Global Parameters</i> window, instead setups
are selected in the <i>Track Setups</i> window.</p>

<p>The value of this parameter is always an integer.  The first setup
will be number 1, the second number 2, and so on.   You can set this
parameter from a script to change setups.  The value in a script may either
be the number or the name.</p>

<p>You can also change setups in a script by using the 
<a href='scripts.htm#Setup'>Setup</a> statement.
The behavior is the same, we prefer using the <i>Setup</i> statement.  Because
of this the setup parameter is relatively useless, you can change it with
a function and scripts almost never need to know the number of the currently
selected setup.</p>

<p><b>Script example:</b></p>
<pre>
    set setup 2
    set setup "My Setup"

<section><title>Trace Debug Level</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> traceDebugLevel</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> an integer from 0 to 4</p>

<p>This parameter determines how much information Mobius will be sent
to the Windows <i>debug output stream</i> as it runs.  It is found
under the <i>Advanced</i> tab of the <i>Global Parameters</i> window.
This parameter is only meaningful when running on Windows.</p>

<p>The default value is 2 which means both serious errors and
operational status messages are sent.</p>

in the <i>Exploring Mobius</i> manual for more information on trace
and the debug output stream.</p>

</section> <!-- Trace Debug Level -->

<section><title>Trace Print Level</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> tracePrintLevel</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> an integer from 0 to 4</p>

<p>This parameter determines how much information Mobius will be sent
to the <i>console</i> as it runs.  It is found under
the <i>Advanced</i> tab of the <i>Global Parameters</i> window.  This
parameter is only meaningful when running on Windows.</p>

<p>The default value is 1 which means only serious errors are sent.</p>

<p>See <a href='exploring.htm#Trace'>Trace</a> 
in the <i>Exploring Mobius</i> manual for more information on trace
and what the "console" means for Windows and Mac.</p>

</section> <!-- Trace Print Level -->

<section><title>Track Groups</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> trackGroups</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> an integer from 0 to 8</p>

<p>This parameter has the maximum number of track groups that can be used
as a <i>binding scope</i>..  It is found under the <i>Limits</i>
tab in the <i>Global Parameters</i> window.  The default value is 2.</p>

<p>Setting this to 1 makes track groups behave exactly like <i>Focus
Lock</i> so that is not usually done.  Setting it to a number higher
than the number of tracks may be done but is not recommended since you
can't make effective use of all the groups.  Typically the number is
2, 3, or 4.</p>

<p>See <a href='exploring.htm#trackGroup'>Track Groups</a>
in the <i>Exploring Mobius</i> manual for more information.</p>

</section> <!-- Track Groups -->

<section><title>Tracks</title>

<p><b>Internal name:</b> tracks</p>
<p><b>Internal value:</b> an integer from 1 to 16</p>

<p>This parameter has the number of tracks that will be shown in the
main window. It is found under the <i>Limits</i> tab of the <i>Global
Parameters</i> window.  The default value is 8.</p>

<p>You can set this number lower to save space in the user interface if you
don't need 8 tracks.  You can also set it higher if you need more, but there
are problems drawing the user interface if you have too many tracks.  Changing
the parameter will not take effect until you restart Mobius.</p>

<p>Because changes do not take effect until a restart, it is meaningless
to set this parameter in a script.  You might reference it in a script if
you need to know how many tracks there are.</p>
