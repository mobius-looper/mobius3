<a name='Introduction'>
<h1 class=sec1>1 Introduction</h1>
</a>
<p>Mobius may be controlled and monitored using the Open Sound Control
(OSC) protocol.  This is an advanced topic intended for users that are
already very familar with OSC, and have a hardware device
capable of sending and receiving OSC messages.  Mobius OSC support was
tested primarily using
the popular <i>TouchOSC</i> application for Apple and Android mobile devices but any device
that supports OSC should be usable.  To get the most out of OSC it is important
that the device be programmable so that it can send addresses and
arguments that are compatible with Mobius.  If a device sends a fixed message,
such as the default layouts in <i>TouchOSC</i>, it is still possible to use
it with Mobius but it will require more effort to configure.</p>
<p>OSC support is a relatively new feature that not many people use.
If you have problems or suggestions, please do not hesitate to 
post on the Mobius forums.</p>
<a name='Network Configuration'>
<h1 class=sec1>2 Network Configuration</h1>
</a>
<p>To communicate with an OSC device you must set four
parameters in the <i>Global Parameters</i> dialog under the
<i>Advanced</i> tab.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>OSC Enable</b> - check to enable the OSC interface</li>
<li><b>OSC Input Port</b> - the port number on on the computer where we will listen for OSC messages</li>
<li><b>OSC Output Host</b> - the IP address of the OSC device where we will send messages</li>
<li><b>OSC Output Port</b> - the port number on the OSC device where we will send messages</li>
<li><b>OSC Trace</b> - check to enable OSC trace messages</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't understand what any of that means, then we're sorry but
you're not ready for OSC.  Post a message on the forums if you need
assistance, but unfortunately OSC requires some knowledge
of TCP/IP networking, and this document is not a tutorial.</p>
<p>The <i>OSC Enable</i> defaults to false so we won't open 
network sockets that aren't needed.  This must be checked if you
want to use OSC.</p>
<p>The <i>OSC Input Port</i> defaults to 7000.  There is probably not
a need to change this, but in rare situations there may be a conflict
with another application that wants to use this port.  Diagnosing
port conflicts is beyond the scope of this document.  Try it and if
it doesn't work, post to the forum.</p>
<p>The <i>OSC Output Host</i> must be the IP address of the device
that will be sending and receiving OSC messages.  This is not required,
but it is desireable if you want to see controls in the OSC device match
the current Mobius paramters.  For example, if you bind an OSC address
to the <i>Output Level</i> parameter, we can send the device a message
every time the output level changes due to a MIDI pedal, moving
the UI knob, a script, or any other means of changing the parameter.
An IP address has the form of four numbers seperated by periods, for
home networks, the IP addres normally starts with "192.168.1" and
ends with a number between 100 and 200.</p>
<p>The <i>OSC Output Port</i> defaults to 9000 which is the default
port number used by <i>TouchOSC</i>.  This must be changed if your device
listens on a different port and you want the device to receive
notifications when Mobius parameters change.</p>
<p>The <i>OSC Trace</i> - checkbox enables sending trace messages
whenever OSC messages are received or sent.  On Mac, the messages
are sent to the system console.  On Windows, they are send
to the debug output stream and you will need to use an application
such as DBWIN32 to view them.  See the section
<a href='exploring.htm#Trace'>Trace</a>
 in the <i>Exploring Mobius</i>
manual for more information on how to enable and view trace messages.
The <i>Trace Debug Level</i> parameter under the <i>Advanced</i> tab
must also be set to 2 to see OSC trace messages.</p>
<p>If you are setting up a new device it is recommended that you
enable trace to help diagnose problems.  Once the device and Mobius
are working properly, disable trace to reduce clutter in the logs.</p>
<a name='Addresses and Arguments'>
<h1 class=sec1>3 Addresses and Arguments</h1>
</a>
<p>Mobius OSC messages must contain an address and usually one
floating point argument without a type tag.  Mobius addresses always
begin with the string <b>/mobius</b> and follow this pattern:</p>
<div class='exampleOuter'>
<div class='exampleInner'>
<pre>
    /mobius/trigger/scope/target/value
</pre>
</div></div>
<p>The <b>/trigger</b> container is optional and is usually not included.
It can be used to convey information about how the physical device
is behaving, if this is different than the default Mobius expectations.
This will be described in detail later.</p>
<p>The <b>/scope</b> container is optional and may contain one
of the following values.</p>
<ul>
<li>The word <b>global</b></li>
<li>A track number starting with 1</li>
<li>A group letter starting with A</li>
</ul>
<p>If a scope is not specified in the address it defaults to <b>global</b>.
Here are some example addresses containing scopes, the first two are
the same because the default scope is <i>global</i>:</p>
<div class='exampleOuter'>
<div class='exampleInner'>
<pre>
    /mobius/global/...
    /mobius/...
    /mobius/1/...
    /mobius/A/...
</pre>
</div></div>
<p>The <b>/target</b> container is not optional, it must be the name
of a Mobius function or parameter, for example "record" or "subCycles".
Target names must use <i>script names</i> which may be different
than the names displayed in the user interface.  Consult the reference
manual to find the script names that correspond to the display names.
Often the script name is the same as the display name but with spaces
removed, so what is displayed as "Auto Record" would be "AutoRecord"
in the address.  Case does not matter.</p>
<p>To change setups, presets, or binding overlays the the target
names are "setup", "preset", or "bindings".  These are the same as
the parameter names used to select configuration objects with plugin
parameter bindings.  Here are some example addresses with targets:</p>
<div class='exampleOuter'>
<div class='exampleInner'>
<pre>
    /mobius/global/record
    /mobious/global/preset
    /mobius/1/quantize
    /mobius/A/output
</pre>
</div></div>
<p>The <b>/value</b> container is where things start to get complicated.
In order to support a wide variety of devices with different
levels of programability, values can be specified in three ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>argument</b> - the value is specified by the OSC message argument</li>
<li><b>absolute</b> - the value is specified in the address</li>
<li><b>relative</b> - an adjustment to the current value is specified in the address, with the amount of adjustment specified by the OSC message argument</li>
</ul>
<p>We will discuss ways to specify target values in more detail below,
here are some examples:</p>
<div class='exampleOuter'>
<div class='exampleInner'>
<pre>
    -- these use arguments

    /mobius/global/output  0.5
    /mobius/1/quantize  0.333

    -- these are absolute

    /mobius/global/preset/Default+Preset
    /mobius/1/quantize/subcycle
    /mobius/A/pan/center
    /mobius/global/output/max

    -- these are relative

    /mobius/global/output/up  1.0
    /mobius/8/feedback/down  5.0

    /mobius/global/output/up/1
    /mobius/8/feedback/down/5
</pre>
</div></div>
<a name='Buttons and Sliders'>
<h1 class=sec1>4 Buttons and Sliders</h1>
</a>
<p>Before determining the best way to specify Mobius addresses and
arguments, we need to consider how the hardware that is sending OSC
messages behaves.  A device typically contains a mixture of physical
controls that behave in one of these ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>continuous</b> - a slider or rotary knob that sweeps between a range of values</li>
<li><b>momentary</b> - a button that sends a value when it is pressed and another when it is released</li>
<li><b>single</b> - a button that sends a value when it is pressed, but not when it is released</li>
<li><b>toggle</b> - a variation of the single button, it sends a value when it is pressed, and a different value when it is pressed a second time</li>
<li><b>xy</b> - a rectangular area with a "puck" that sends two values as the puck is moved</li>
</ul>
<p>You can set Mobius parameters using any of these control types.  
Continuous controls are useful if you want to to sweep through
the possible values of a parameter.  Often the track control parameters such
as "input", "output" and "feedback" are associated with physical
controls that resemble sliders.  Enumerated parameters such
as "quantize" or "recordThreshold" might be assigned to rotary knobs.</p>
<p>You can also use buttons to set parameters.  In this case the
button will either force the parameter to a
particular value (absolute), or raise and lower the value of 
the parameter by some amount (relative).</p>
<p>To execute Mobius functions you almost always use physical
controls that have button behvaior.  It is possible to execute
Mobius functions with sliders but this can be difficult
to use.  When executing functions, it is important to understand
the differemce between momentary, single and toggle buttons.</p>
<p>Many Mobius functions are "sustainable" which means they
can have different behavior when a button is pressed and released,
or when a button is held down for a period of time.  If you
wish to use any of the sustainable or long-pressable functions, 
you must use physical buttons that behave as momentary buttons,
sending a message both when it is pressed and released.  
All <i>TouchOSC</i> buttons behave this way.</p>
<p>It is posssible to use single message buttons to execute
functions but Mobius has to be told not to expect the extra
release message.  Otherwise sustainable functions will enter
their long-press state because they never see the up transition
of the button.  This is done with a special keyword in the
address and is described below.</p>
<p>Toggle buttons are not very useful with Mobius.  They
are typically used for effects parameters such as chorusing
or reverb, where you want to press once to enable the effect, then
press again to disable the effect.  Such buttons typically send 1.0
when they are pressed once, 0.0 when pressed again, then repeat
the 1.0 and 0.0 pattern forever.  This behavior might be useful
for some parameters, for example toggling quantize mode
between "loop" and "off", but this is not recommended for executing
functions.</p>
<p>XY controls can be used to set Mobius parameters but we have
not seen many interesting examples.  If you find one let us know!</p>
<a name='Argument Values'>
<h1 class=sec1>5 Argument Values</h1>
</a>
<p>The OSC devices with which we are familar send one and rarely two 
arguments that are floating point numbers.  The argument usually
has a default range of 0.0 to 1.0.</p>
<p>When a slider is down, the value 0.0 is sent and as it is
raised the value increases smoothly until it reaches 1.0 at the
top end of the slider range.   Momentary buttons usually send
1.0 when the button is pressed and 0.0 when the button is released.
This is the default behavior of <i>TouchOSC</i> controls.</p>
<p>To minimize the amount of programming for <i>TouchOSC</i>, Mobius
will expect most arguments to be in the range of 0.0 to 1.0,
though in some cases this can be adjusted.</p>
<a name='scaledArguments'>
<h1 class=sec1>6 Setting Parameters With Scaled OSC Arguments</h1>
</a>
<p>To set a parmaeter with OSC arguments, use an address
path without a value container, for example.</p>
<div class='exampleOuter'>
<div class='exampleInner'>
<pre>
    /mobius/global/output
</pre>
</div></div>
<p>One argument is expected to be sent with the message whose value
ranges from 0.0 to 1.0.  Mobius will take the floating point range and
scale it into an integer or "ordinal" range for the target, in this
example the <i>output</i> parameter.  The <i>output</i> parameter has
an ordinal range from 0 to 127, so an OSC argument of 0.0 becomes
output level 0, 1.0 becomes 127 and 0.5 is approximately 64.  This is
almost always done when the physical device is a slider or rotary
knob.  This style of argument is convenient if you want to smoothly
sweep the knob over all possible values of the parameter.</p>
<p>It is also possible to set values with a button, but this
is not often done with scaled OSC arguments.  To set the value of 
a parameter you must know the floating point range of each of the
possible parmeter values.  For example the <i>quantize</i> parameter
has four possible values: off, subcycle, cycle, and loop.  This divides
the floating range by four, so values from 0.0 to 0.2499999 select <i>off</i>,
values from 0.25 to 0.4999999 select <i>subcycle</i> and so on.  It
is inconveinent for the device programmer to calculate these values so
instead parameters set with buttons usually use 
<a href='#addressArguments'>address values</a> or
<a href='#ordinalArguments'>ordinal arguments</a>.</p>
<p>Another problem setting parameters with buttons, is that many
devices use momentary buttons and send a message when it is pressed
and again when it is released.  When setting Mobius parameters
you usually want to ignore this second message.   For example,
say we're configuring a <i>TouchOSC</i> button to set the <i>quantize</i>
parameter to <i>loop</i>.  You set set the high value to 1.0,
but what about the low value?  If you leave it at 0.0 the parameter
will change twice, once when you press the button and again when
you release since 0.0 is the value for "off".  To avoid this you
must set the low value of the button to -1.0 or any other negative
number.  Mobius will ignore the negative value and leave the parameter
set to 1.0.</p>
<a name='addressArguments'>
<h1 class=sec1>7 Setting Parameters With Address Values</h1>
</a>
<p>When setting parameters with buttons, the most convenient
approach is to include the value you want to set in the
address rather than use the OSC argument.  For example:</p>
<div class='exampleOuter'>
<div class='exampleInner'>
<pre>
    /mobius/global/quantize/loop
</pre>
</div></div>
<p>The <i>quantize</i> parameter value will be set to <i>loop</i> 
whenever this message is received with a non-zero argument.  
Since the default behavior of <i>TouchOSC</i> is to send 1.0 on button
press and 0.0 on release, the message is processed
when 1.0 is sent, but the message is ignored when 0.0 is sent
so we won't try to change the parameter twice every time a button
is pressed.</p>
<p>This is convenient for two reasons, first you don't have to 
worry so much about the value of the argument since most
devices default to 0.0 to 1.0.  Second, you don't have to 
calculate the numeric form of each parameter value, 
instead you can reference them <b>by name</b> just as
you would in a script.</p>
<p>When you use this style of address you normally do not
send it from a slider or knob.  As you sweep over the slider
range, we will set the parameter to the same value many times
which adds overhead and accomplishes nothing.</p>
<p>To set the value container, consult the reference manual
for each parameter.  If the parmaeter value is an <i>enumeration</i>
the set of possible values are listed.  If the value is an integer
the minimum and maxmum values will be given.  
For example, the output level parameter range is from
0 to 127, so these are some valid example addresses.</p>
<div class='exampleOuter'>
<div class='exampleInner'>
<pre>
    /mobius/global/output/0
    /mobius/global/output/42
    /mobius/global/output/127
</pre>
</div></div>
<p>To change presets, setups or binding overlays, you reference
the objects using the name they have in the user interface.  These
names often contain spaces which are not allowed in OSC
addreses.  You must substitute the plus '+' character for
spaces in configuration object names:</p>
<div class='exampleOuter'>
<div class='exampleInner'>
<pre>
    /mobius/global/setup/Default+Setup
    /mobius/1/preset/Glitch+Core
    /mobius/bindings/Nano+Control
</pre>
</div></div>
<p>There are also a few special symbols that may be used instead
of parameter values.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>min</b> - set the parameter to the minimum value</li>
<li><b>max</b> - set the parameter to the maximum value</li>
<li><b>center</b> - set the parameter to the center value</li>
</ul>
<p>These symbolic values are the most useful for the track level
parameters.</p>
<div class='exampleOuter'>
<div class='exampleInner'>
<pre>
    /mobius/global/output/max
    /mobius/global/feedback/min
    /mobius/global/pan/center
</pre>
</div></div>
<a name='ordinalArguments'>
<h1 class=sec1>8 Setting Parameters With Ordinal Arguments</h1>
</a>
<p>If you have an OSC device that can be programmed to send any argument
value, you can choose to set the Mobius parameter to the value 
of the argument using ordinal nubmers.  Ordinals are integers that
usually have a minimum value of zero and a maximum value less than 100.
A few have minimum values that are negative.  To set parameters
with ordinals add the keyword <b>arg</b> to the end of the address.</p>
<div class='exampleOuter'>
<div class='exampleInner'>
<pre>
    /mobius/global/output/arg
</pre>
</div></div>
<p>This differs from using <a href='#scaledArguments'>scaled arguments</a>
in that the argument is not expected to be a floating value from 0.0 to 1.0.
Instead it is expected to be an integer that fits within the range
allowed by the target parameter.  In this example, the target is <i>output</i>
which expects values from 0 to 127.</p>
<p>Ordinal arguments accomplish the same thing as using 
<a href='#addressArguments'>address arguments</a> and are a bit more
obscure since they require ordinal parameter numbers, whereas 
address arguments may use symbolic values.</p>
<p>In the previous example, if the device was programmed to send
an argument value of 100, the same effect could be achieved using
an address argument.</p>
<div class='exampleOuter'>
<div class='exampleInner'>
<pre>
    /mobius/global/output/100
</pre>
</div></div>
<a name='Setting Parameters With Relative Values'>
<h1 class=sec1>9 Setting Parameters With Relative Values</h1>
</a>
<p>A variation on setting parameters with addresses is to 
use the address to specify a <i>relative</i> value.  There
are two special sumbols you can use in the value container
to set relative values.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>up</b> - raise the parameter value</li>
<li><b>down</b> - lower the parameter value</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class='exampleOuter'>
<div class='exampleInner'>
<pre>
    /mobius/global/output/up
    /mobius/1/feedback/down
</pre>
</div></div>
<p>The amount to raise or lower the value is specified by
the OSC argument.  So assuming the <i>TouchOSC</i> default of 1.0
for button presses, the values will rise and lower by 1.  If
you create a custom <i>TouchOSC</i> layout you can adjust the maximum
value to achieve higher amounts of adjustment.  For example
a button with a maximum value of 5.0 will raise or lower
the parameter value by 5 units each press.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to program a custom template, you
may also specify the amount of change in the address.
For example:</p>
<div class='exampleOuter'>
<div class='exampleInner'>
<pre>
    /mobius/global/output/up/5
    /mobius/1/feedback/down/20
</pre>
</div></div>
<p>This style of address can be used with any parameter, the
value will be automatically constrained so the parameter can't
go beyond it's minimum and maximum values.  The value of the
OSC argument doesn't matter as long as it is possitive.  Positive
argument values will cause the parmameter to be changed, 
zero or negative values are ignored, 
which is necessary for buttons that send 0.0 when they are released.</p>
<p>Setting parameters values in the address is convenient for devices
that have only buttons or a limited number of sliders.</p>
<a name='Executing Functions'>
<h1 class=sec1>10 Executing Functions</h1>
</a>
<p>Functions are almost always executed using a physical control
that behaves as a button.  It is possible to execute functions
with sliders but it takes more effort.  Wherever possible, the
button should be programmed to send an argument of 1.0 when the
button is pressed and 0.0 when it is released.  It doesn't really
matter what the press value is but the release value must
be 0.0.  If the release value is not 0.0, mobius will execute
the function again when the button is released which is 
not normally desired. Here are some examples of function addresses:</p>
<div class='exampleOuter'>
<div class='exampleInner'>
<pre>
    /mobius/global/record
    /mobius/1/speedDown
    /mobius/A/mute
</pre>
</div></div>
<p>If the button does not send a value on release, Mobius needs
to be told this so it won't think that the button is being
held down.  This is important for all "sustainable" functions
that may have different actions on press and release, or change
behavior after a long press.  If the button will not send
a release value the special symbol <b>/noup</b> must be added
to the address after the <b>/mobius</b> container.</p>
<div class='exampleOuter'>
<div class='exampleInner'>
<pre>
    /mobius/noup/global/record
</pre>
</div></div>
<p>When the <i>/noup</i> trigger qualifier is used, the value of the OSC
argument is ignored.  Any time a message is received
with this address the function is executed, and we will not
wait for a release message.</p>
<p>A few functions may take a single integer argument when used
in scripts.  Some examples are <i>divide</i> which instantly
divides the loop by a number, and <i>speedUp</i> which raises
the speed of the loop by a number of semitones.  For those functions
that recognize arguments, you may specify the argument in the address.</p>
<div class='exampleOuter'>
<div class='exampleInner'>
<pre>
    /mobius/global/divide/5
    /mobius/1/speedDown/12
</pre>
</div></div>
<p>There is usually no need to combine a numeric function argument with
the <i>/noup</i> option.  Functions that take argumets are assumed to not
be sustainble.  There may however be scripts that are sustainable
and take an argument.  So it is best if you consistently add <i>/noup</i>
if you know the device will not behave like a momentary button.</p>
<a name='Address Translation'>
<h1 class=sec1>11 Address Translation</h1>
</a>
<p>If your device does not support programmable addresses, or if you
wish to use the default <i>TouchOSC</i> templates without creating custom
templates, you can still use the device with Mobius, but it requires
editing an XML file.  The file is named <b>osc.xml</b>.  On Windows it
is found in the installation directory, usually <i>c:\Program Files\Mobius 2</i>.  On Mac this is found in <i>/Library/Application Support/Mobius 2</i>.</p>
<p>You need to be comfortable with XML syntax and selecting text encodings
to edit this file.  See 
<a href='starting.htm#editingXml'>this section</a>
 in the <i>Getting Started</i>
manual for more information on the proper way to edit XML files.</p>
<p>The default <i>osc.xml</i> file contains a single &lt;OscConfig&gt; element
which in turn contains several &lt;OscBindingSet&gt; elements.
An &lt;OscBindingSet&gt; contains several &lt;Binding&gt; elements.  
Each &lt;Binding&gt; defines the translation between the incomming OSC address
(triggerPath) and the corresponding Mobius address (targetPath).</p>
<div class='exampleOuter'>
<div class='exampleInner'>
<pre>
&lt;OscConfig&gt;
  &lt;OscBindingSet name="Touch OSC Simple" active='true'&gt;
    &lt;Binding triggerType='continuous' triggerPath='/1/fader1' targetPath='/mobius/1/output'/&gt;
    &lt;Binding triggerType='continuous' triggerPath='/1/fader2' targetPath='/mobius/2/output'/&gt;
    &lt;Binding triggerType='continuous' triggerPath='/1/fader3' targetPath='/mobius/3/output'/&gt;
    &lt;Binding triggerType='continuous' triggerPath='/1/fader4' targetPath='/mobius/4/output'/&gt;
    &lt;Binding triggerType='continuous' triggerPath='/1/fader5' targetPath='/mobius/global/pan'/&gt;
    &lt;Binding triggerType='toggle' triggerPath='/1/toggle1' targetPath='/mobius/noup/record/&gt;
    &lt;Binding triggerType='toggle' triggerPath='/1/toggle2' targetPath='/mobius/noup/overdub/&gt;
    &lt;Binding triggerType='toggle' triggerPath='/1/toggle3' targetPath='/mobius/noup/mute/&gt;
    &lt;Binding triggerType='toggle' triggerPath='/1/toggle4' targetPath='/mobius/noup/reset/&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/OscBindingSet&gt;
  &lt;OscBindingSet name="Touch OSC Beat Machine"&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/OscBindingSet&gt;
  &lt;OscBindingSet name="Touch OSC Keys"&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/OscBindingSet&gt;
  ...
&lt;/OscConfig&gt;
</pre>
</div></div>
<p>Only one OscBindingSet may be active at a time, this is indiciated
by setting the XML attribute <i>active</i> to <i>true</i> as seen in
the above example.  If more than one &lt;OscBindingSet&gt; set is marked
active, the first one is chosen.  If no binding sets are active the
first one in the &lt;OscConfig&gt; is chosen.</p>
<p>The active binding set is consulted whenever an OSC message is
received.  We search for a &lt;Binding&gt; whose <i>triggerPath</i>
matches the address from the OSC message.  In the examples above,
the <i>triggerPath</i> values are the messages sent by <i>TouchOsc</i> in
one of it's default configurations.  If a matching &lt;Binding&gt; is
found, the value of the <i>targetPath</i> is used to process the
message instead of the one that was received from the
device.  <i>targetPath</i> values conform to the Mobius address format
described earlier in this document.</p>
<p>The <i>triggerType</i> value tells Mobius about the behavior of the 
physical OSC trigger and the values the OSC message argument will have.
This is optional because Mobius can usually figure out the appropiate
trigger type based on the targetPath and trigger options 
such as <i>/noup</i>.  The possible values are.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>continuous</b> - argument sweeps from 0.0 to 1.0</li>
<li><b>momentary</b> - argument is 1.0 when a button is pressed and 0.0 when released</li>
<li><b>once</b> - argument is 1.0 a the button is pressed and nothing is sent when the button is released</li>
<li><b>toggle</b> - argument is 1.0 when button is pressed once and 0.0 when pressed again</li>
<li><b>xy</b> - a pair of arguments from 0.0 to 1.0 is sent for each coordinate in a rectangle</li>
</ul>
<p>For <i>TouchOSC</i>, incoming paths that contain the word "fader" or "rotary" are
<i>continuous</i>, paths with the word "toggle" are <i>toggle</i>,
and paths with the word "push" are <i>momentary</i>.  Mobius currently
cannot make use of <i>xy</i> messages.</p>
<a name='Status Export'>
<h1 class=sec1>12 Status Export</h1>
</a>
<p>In addition to receiving OSC messages, Mobius may also send OSC messages so that
the device can display the current Mobius state.  By default, any OSC
address whose target is a parameter and whose argument is a continuous value
from 0.0 to 1.0 will be automatically exported when the parmeter is changed.
So if you use an address like this:</p>
<div class='exampleOuter'>
<div class='exampleInner'>
<pre>
    /mobius/output
</pre>
</div></div>
<p>A message will be sent back to the OSC device using the same address
whenever the output level changes.  For this to work you must configure
the <i>OSC Output Host</i> and <i>OSC Output Port</i> in the Mobius
<i>Global Parameters</i> window.</p>
<p>Note that addresses that target functions, or that include
specific values will not be exported.  For example, these
address cannot be exported.</p>
<div class='exampleOuter'>
<div class='exampleInner'>
<pre>
    /mobius/record
    /mobius/output/127
    /mobius/output/up
    /mobius/output/arg
</pre>
</div></div>
<p>In addition the automatic export of continuous parameters, there
are a few special values that may be exported but cannot be set.
These are called <i>Watch Points</i>.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>loopLocation</b> - the current playback location in the loop</li>
<li><b>loopStart</b> - flashes at the loop start point</li>
<li><b>loopSubcycle</b> - flashes at the loop start point</li>
<li><b>loopCycle</b> - flashes at the loop start point</li>
<li><b>modeRecord</b> - set when the loop is in record mode</li>
</ul>
<p>Watch points are still under development, if you have ideas
about Mobius states that should be exporable as watch points please
let us know.</p>
<p>When a watch point is continuous such as <i>loopLocation</i>
the value will be constantly changing.  The output value will be 
scaled to the range 0.0 and 1.0.   For <i>TouchOSC</i> this
can be used with fader or rotary controls.</p>
<p>When a watch point <i>flashes</i> it indicates that the state
is instant and does not have a time duration.  For example when the
loop reaches the start point.  For instant watch points, an OSC
message will be sent with value 1.0 when the state is reached, 
and a short time later a message with value 0.0 is sent.  This 
can be used to turn lights on the OSC device on and off.  For
<i>TouchOSC</i> this should be used with toggle buttons.</p>
<p>When a watch point is "modal" such as <i>modeRecord</i>
it turns on and off for an undefined time.  A 1.0 will be
sent when the mode is entered and 0.0 when it is exited.</p>
<p>To export watch points, you must edit the <i>osc.xml</i> file
and add &lt;OscWatcher&gt; elements.  These elements appear
as immediate childrenof the &lt;OscConfig&gt; element.  For example:</p>
<div class='exampleOuter'>
<div class='exampleInner'>
<pre>
&lt;OscConfig&gt;
  &lt;OscWatcher name='loopLocation' path='/1/fader1'/&gt;
  &lt;OscWatcher name='loopStart' track='1' path='/1/toggle1'/&gt;
  &lt;OscBindingSet&gt;
     ...
  &lt;OscBindingSet&gt;
  ...
&lt;OscConfig&gt;
</pre>
</div></div>
<p>In this example, the loop location of the currently selected
track will be sent to the OSC device using the address <i>/1/fader1</i>.
In the second &lt;OscWathcer&gt;, a specific track is specified so the
OSC device will be send a message to <i>/1/toggle1</i> only when the
loop in track 1 reaches its start point.</p>
<a name='Latency'>
<h2 class=sec2>12.1 Latency</h2>
</a>
<p>There may be a considerable delay between the time that a Mobius
watch point is reached and the OSC device responds to the message.
So while watch point port export can give you a general idea
of what is happening, it is not always suitable for making 
time critical decisions, such as synchronization or as
a metronome.  Mobius sends messages as fast as it can, but 
wireless networks and mobile devices can both add
delays that are not under the control of Mobius.</p>
<a name='Reloading the OSC Configuration File'>
<h1 class=sec1>13 Reloading the OSC Configuration File</h1>
</a>
<p>If you decide to use address mapping or define watch points
in the OSC configuration file (osc.xml) you will need to reload it
every time you make changes.  The file
is loaded once when Mobius starts.  If you want to reload the file
without restarting Mobius, open the <i>File</i> menu and select the 
<i>Reload OSC</i> item.</p>
<a name='TouchOSC Tips'>
<h1 class=sec1>14 TouchOSC Tips</h1>
</a>
<p>The most inexpensive way to use OSC with Mobius is through the 
<i>TouchOSC</i> application for Apple and Android mobile devices.  It is available
<a href='http://hexler.net/software/touchosc'>here</a>
.  <i>TouchOSC</i> provides
a few default layouts such as <i>Beat Machine</i> and <i>Keys</i>
but it is also fully programmable with the <i>TouchOSC Editor</i>.</p>
<p>The default layouts the send messages such as <i>/1/fader1/</i> can be used
but they require editing the <a href='#Address Translation'>Address Translation</a> file. For most
people it is easier to use the <i>TouchOSC Editor</i> to send address
that Mobius understands without mapping.</p>
<p>For Mobius, the most useful layout object types are
<i>Push Button</i>, <i>Fader V</i>, <i>Fader H</i>, <i>Rotary V</i>, and <i>Rotary H</i>.
Use <i>Push Button</i> to execute functions or set specific parameter values, 
and use <i>Fader</i> and <i>Rotary</i> to sweep through paramter values.</p>
<p><i>Toggle Button</i> can be used but it doesn't work very well since Mobius does not
have many concepts that behave like toggles.  You might use this to swtich between
two parameter values, but it is not suitable for executing functions.</p>
<p><i>XY Pad</i> and the various <i>Multi</i> types are not usable with Mobius.</p>
<p>The read-only status types such as <i>LED</i> and <i>Battery V</i> can
be used as the targets for <a href='#Status Export'>OscWatcher</a>s.</p>
