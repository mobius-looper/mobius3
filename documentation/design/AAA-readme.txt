The files in this directory capture detailed design notes for portions
of the system that got too large or meandering for code comments.
Some of the older novellas cluttering up the code should be moved here too.

Code comments should refer to these files when there is more to say about
something.

Compared to the "notes" directory, keep things here relaitvely concise and
accurate, suitable for a more formal design document.  Avoid long-winded
brainstorming sessions that reach no conclusions. 

THe "notes" directory by comparision is a chaotic mess of random though
digressions, some of which are incomplete, inaccurate, or unimplemented.
