Inno Setup is an old and popular installation builder for Windows

Get it here:

The main competitor in the free space is Nullsoft which I used
in OG Mobius, but the Juce tutorials used Inno and I wanted to try it.
They seem comparable.

File Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

MobiusInstaller.iss

This is the INNO script file that is compiled to create the installer.
Use the "Inno Setup Compiler" to compile it.

In order to get things into c:\Program Files you have to allow "Install for all users"
with "elevated privileges".  Do NOT uncomment the ProvilegesRequired=lowest line in the
default script.

The installer will put the things here:

   ROOT="c:/Users/jeff/AppData/Local/Circular Labs/Mobius"

This is the convention used for all non-binary user files.

Inno without modification uses this for the destination

  C:\Users\Jeff\AppData\Local\Programs\Mobius

This is where {app} goes

Wow, it worked pretty well.  Created a desktop icon with the big blue globe.
Icon name has "Mobius" but the .exe can be anything.

Everything went here:

  -rw-rw-rw-  1 Jeff None     5513 05-10 21:53 help.xml
  -rw-rw-rw-  1 Jeff None     8792 05-08 22:12 mobius.xml
  -rw-rw-rw-  1 Jeff None     3072 05-09 00:46 uiconfig.xml
  -rwxrwxrwx  1 Jeff None 18935296 05-09 00:43 UI.exe
  -rw-rw-rw-  1 Jeff None     2353 05-10 22:01 unins000.dat
  -rwxrwxrwx  1 Jeff None  3223613 05-10 21:55 unins000.exe

Changed to use {userappdata} for the .xml files

That put the files in c:/Users/Jeff/AppData/Roaming WITHOUT a "Mobius" wrapper folder.

This is bad because it was supposed to go in Local rather than Roaming since I did a
non-administrative install.

Almost all apps install into c:\Program Files, certainly major ones.  So {app} is not a good location.

{commonpf64} is:

{localappdata} is what I want, {userappdata} and {commonappdata} are the same thing
and go into Roaming

Sigh, commonpf requires admin privs so if you want lowest it has to go into AppData\Programs which
no one seems to do.

After allowing admin for c:\Program Files get a warning about putting files in {localappdata}
At least Bome does this too, not sure why it is bitching

Probably wants me to use {commonappdata} which is not documented where it goes.  Try it:

It goes in c:/ProgramData

Yeah, I hate putting them here because you can't edit them by hand.

Vastly prefer putting them in localappdata, despite the warning.  The only reason to put the .exe
in Program Files is because that's where everyone expects it to go.

Weirdly, Ableton puts the .exe under c:/ProgramData
